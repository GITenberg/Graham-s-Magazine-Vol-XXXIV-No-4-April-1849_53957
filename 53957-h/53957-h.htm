<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_1'>PART I.</h2>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'>Do not draw upon you a person’s enmity, for enmity is
never appeased—injury returns upon him who injures—and
sharp words recoil against him who says them.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>Chinese Proverb.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the green and flowery banks of the beautiful
Lake Tai-hoo, whose surface bears a thousand isles,
resting like emeralds amid translucent pearl, dwelt
Whanki the mother of Lí. <span class='it'>The mother of Lí!</span> Ah
happy distinction—ah envied title! For where, far
or near, was the name could rank with Lí on the
scroll of learning—receiving even in childhood the
title of the “Exiled Immortal,” from his skill in
classic and historical lore!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, he was of a most beautiful countenance,
while the antelope that fed among the hills
was not more swift of foot. Who like Lí could
draw such music from the seven silken strings of the
Kin! or when with graceful touch his fingers swept
the lute, adding thereto the well-skilled melody of his
voice, youths and maidens opened their ears to listen,
for wonderful was the ravishing harmony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet although the gods of learning smiled upon this
youthful disciple of Confucius, poverty came also
with her iron hand, and although she could not crush
the active mind of Lí, with a strong grip, she held him
back from testing his skill with the ambitious <span class='it'>literati</span>,
both old and young, who annually flocked to the
capital to present their themes before the examiners.
For even in those days as the present, money was
required to purchase the smiles of these severe
judges. They must read with <span class='it'>golden</span> spectacles—or
wo to the unhappy youth who, buoyant with hope
and—<span class='it'>empty pockets</span>, comes before them! With
what contempt is his essay cast aside, not worth the
reading!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sorely vexed, therefore, was poor Lí—and what
wonder—to know that he might safely cope with any
candidate in the “<a id='halls'></a>Scientific Halls,” yet dare not for
the lack of <span class='it'>sycee</span> (silver) enter their gates, lest disgrace
might fall upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Lí was of a merry heart—and, as all the world
knows, there is no better panacea for the ills of fortune
than the spirit of cheerfulness. Thus, although
poverty barred the way to promotion, it could not
materially affect his happiness—no more than the
passing wind which for a moment ruffled the surface
of the lake, yet had no power to move its depths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now it happened that one day taking his nets Lí
went down to the lake, and as he cast them within
the waters, not knowing any one was near, he broke
forth into a merry song, which sent its glad burthen
far off to the lips of mocking Echo, like Ariel, seeming
to “ride on the curled clouds.” Now it also
chanced, that within a grove of the graceful bamboo,
which skirted the path down which Lí had passed on
his way, walked the great Mandarin Hok-wan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Hi!</span> by the head of Confucius the fellow sings
well!” he exclaimed, as the song met his ear, (for,
as we have said, Lí had a voice of rare melody,) and
forthwith issuing from his concealment, Hok-wan
seated himself upon the bank and entered into conversation
with the young fisherman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the mere melody of the voice had so charmed
the mandarin, how much more was he captivated by
the wit and learning of the youth, who, thus poorly
appareled, and humbly employed, seemed to share
wisdom with the gods! Hok-wan stroked his eye-brows
in astonishment, and then bidding Lí leave his
nets, he bore him off as a rare prize to his own house,
where he that day feasted a numerous company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First conducting Lí to an inner apartment, he presented
him with a magnificent robe richly embroidered,
together with every article necessary to complete
the toilet of a person of distinction, and when
thus appareled, introduced him into the presence of
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>
his guests. And truly Lí walked in among them
with all the stateliness and hauteur of a man who
feels that he is conferring an honor, instead of being
honored, as no doubt Lí should have considered himself,
in such an august assemblage of grave mandarins.
With what an air he seated himself at the
sumptuously loaded table! where, according to Chinese
custom of the higher classes, the various dishes
of meats, soups, fish, preserves, etc., were all nearly
hidden by large bouquets of beautiful flowers, and
pyramids of green leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now no sooner had Hok-wan delivered with
all customary formality the speech of welcome, and
drained to the health of his guests the tiny goblet of
crystal, embossed with gold, than rising to his feet,
and joining his hands before his breast, in token of
respect to his host, Lí called a servant, and bidding
him take a part from all the good things spread before
him, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carry these to the dwelling of Whanki, the mother
of Lí. Say to her that as the sands on the lake
shore, countless are the blessings of the gods, who
have this day smiled upon her son. Bid her eat—for
although from hunger he should gnaw his flesh,
and from thirst drink his blood, yet not one morsel of
this banquet shall pass the lips of Lí unless his aged
mother be also sustained by the same delicacies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At hearing which, all the mandarins, and Hok-wan
himself, loudly expressed their admiration. Such is
the esteem which the Chinese entertain for filial
piety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This duty discharged, Lí attacked the dainties before
him like a hungry soldier, yet seasoning all he
said and did with so much wit and humor, that the
guests laid down their chop-sticks and listened with
wonder. With the wine, Li grew still more merry—his
wit cut like hail-stones wheresoe’er it lighted,
and at his jovial songs the grave dignitaries forgetting
their rank, (somewhat washed away by copious
draughts of <span class='it'>sam-shu</span>,<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a>) snapped their fingers, wagged
their shorn heads, and even rising from the table
embraced him familiarly. At length, when after an
interval of a few hours their hilarity was somewhat
abated, during which the guests walked in the beautiful
gardens, or reclining upon luxuriant cushions,
regaled themselves with their pipes, or in masticating
their favorite betel-nut, Lí made bare his bosom before
them, and to their astonishment they found it
was only a needy scholar whose praises they had
been shouting.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>A needy scholar!</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>How firmly they clutched their fobs, lest a <span class='it'>candareen</span><a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a>
might jump into the pocket of the needy scholar.
But of advice they were as profuse as grass-hoppers
in August.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to the capital—go to Kiang-fu,” (Nankin the
ancient capital of the empire,) “thou wilt perplex
the learned—thou wilt bewilder the ignorant!” said
one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Hi!</span> this fellow Lí will yet stand with honor before
the emperor,” cried another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Appear boldly in the ‘Scientific Halls’ before
the Examiners,” said a third, “and never fear but
thy name shall be cried at midnight from the highest
tower in the city,<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> as the successful Lí, with whom
no other candidate can compete!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the wind blows over the fields does not
the grass bend before it!” said Hok-wan. “When
the great Ho speaks will not inferiors obey! the
learned academician Ho is my brother—to him then
you shall go—one word from him, and even the
judges themselves shall cry your name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ivory does not come from a rat’s mouth, or gold
from brass clippings,” thought Lí, as he listened to
these remarks—“a few candareens now would be
better for me than all this fine talk—truly I must be
a fool not to know all this stuff before. Yet by the
sacred manes of my ancestors, I <span class='it'>will</span> go to the capital,
and that, too, ere another sun ripens the rice-fields—furnished
with a letter to the illustrious Ho, I
may dare admittance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giddy with wine, and with the excitement of high
hopes for the future, at a late hour Lí was borne in a
sumptuous palankeen to the humble dwelling of
Whanki.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poor old soul at first knew not the gay gallant
who stood before her, so much had the gift-robes of
the mandarin changed his appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Heigh-yah!</span> but, Lí, thou art as fine as a magpie,”
quoth she, raising her head from the pan of
charcoal, over which she seemed to be simmering
something in a small dish—“<span class='it'>Heigh</span>—and now I look
at you again, I see you have drank of that cursed
<span class='it'>sam-shu</span>—forever abhorred be the name of I-tih!<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a>
with all thy wit dost thou not know the wise saying
of Mencius—‘<span class='it'>Like a crane among hens is a man
of parts among fools</span>.’ (It may be inferred, I
think, that the good old Whanki was something of a
scold.) And while thou hast been guzzling, see what
I have prepared for thee—what had <span class='it'>I</span> to do with
birds-nest soup, and with shark’s fins, and with
pigeon’s eggs from the table of Hok-wan! My poor
Lí will be too modest to eat with the great company,
I said to myself, and I will not eat them, but warm
them up to comfort him when he comes back—look,
here they are,” (lifting the dish from the fire) “and
yet thou comest home like a well-fed, stupid swine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now tu-h, mother,” answered Lí, “if thy son
has been drinking with fools, they wore fine feathers—and
now embrace me, for I am going to the
capital.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lí, thou art drunk—go to bed—the capital indeed!
Ah cursed, cursed I-tih!” exclaimed the old
woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when at length Lí convinced her that he was
neither drunk nor crazy, but in reality about to start
for Nankin, as a candidate for honors in the Scientific
Halls, and with a letter to the great Ho in his pouch,
Whanki knocked her head reverently before the
shrine of the household gods in token of gratitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The remainder of the night was passed in preparations
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>
for the journey, and just as the golden ripples
of the lake danced in the rays of the rising sun, Lí
tenderly embraced his aged parent, and set forth on
foot for Nankin, more than a hundred miles distant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, the blessed bug,” quoth the old woman,
gazing after him so long as she could catch a glimpse
of his large bamboo hat, “he will not want for rice
any day—no <span class='it'>sycee</span> has he in his pockets, but such a
tongue in his head, as will bring him food and
honors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whanki was right. In every hamlet he passed
through—in every cottage by the wayside, Lí found
a shelter and a welcome—the good people considering
themselves amply repaid for their hospitality if
the young stranger would but touch the strings of
the <span class='it'>pipa</span>, or recite to them odes from the Shoo-king.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this manner he reached the capital, and crossing
the marble bridge over the great canal, upon the
eastern side, entered the city at the Gate of Extensive
Peace. Going into the first barber’s shop which
offered, Lí carefully plucked <span class='it'>out</span> his beard, (hear this,
ye exquisites of modern days!) shaved his head
anew to the crown, and <a id='plait'></a>plaited his long black hair
with red ribbons. Then entering an adjoining tavern,
he exchanged his dusty, travel-worn garments for
the rich dress presented him by Hok-wan, which he
had preserved with great care for the occasion, and
holding up his fan, to shield his eyes from the sun,
stepped forth into the busy streets, to look for the
dwelling of the illustrious Ho.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And next, within the Hall of Ceremony, in the elegant
mansion of Ho, behold Lí in the presence of the
great man himself—for with the same audacity which
marked his behavior at the dinner of Hok-wan, had
Lí given the door-keeper a vermilion card, leading
Ho to expect a visiter of rank. Advancing three
steps to meet him, Ho bows low to his stranger guest—then
with graceful ease Lí also advances three
step, and bows still lower—Ho again gravely steps
forward and makes another salutation—upon which
Lí again does the same—with a still lower bending
of the body, Ho once more advances—whereupon
Lí, nearly touching the marble pavements with his
forehead, steps forward yet another three steps! By
this time their united and solemn paces had brought
them near the couch upon which visiters are expected
to repose themselves. And here again the
same formalities were gone through with, as to who
should first be seated thereon. But <span class='it'>being</span> seated, Lí
at once burst forth with such a flow of wit and fancy,
that Ho was completely captivated ere he knew the
name or business of the daring youth!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now this was a capital stroke of Lí. For the
academician cared not so much for any dignitary
under the Emperor Supreme, as he did for a man of
learning, or even for one who could tickle the moments
as they flew with witty jests, provoking laughter.
Ho saw at once that Lí not only possessed this
recommendation, but that his knowledge could also
ring on as many topics as there were bells to the
Porcelain Tower. When, therefore, he had perused
the letter of Hok-wan, which, after securing his
ground, Lí put into his hand, and after having listened
to the history which the youth gave of his hard struggles,
of his poverty, and earnest desire to come before
the judges on the day of examination, than Ho,
embracing him, bade him be of good cheer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, by the sacred Budha!” he exclaimed,
“learning like thine shall win its crown without the
aid of propitiatory gifts, save to the gods themselves.
Know, O Lí, that Yang and Kau, who enjoy the
smiles of the great emperor, are this year the examiners.
To them shalt thou go, with no favor but my
name—humble as it is, it shall cause thine to be enrolled
among the <span class='it'>literati</span> of the Imperial Academy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No doubt Ho manifested great vanity in this, in so
much as hinting that his “<span class='it'>humble</span>” name could
balance with gold in the scales of avarice! Nevertheless
Lí was delighted, and immediately set about
piling up such a cloud castle as spread over his
whole heaven of glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the day of examination approached, and
confident of success, Lí boldly presented himself for
admission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Offering the memorial of Ho, which was to insure
him, as he supposed, the favor of the judges, he was
much surprised to see those great men, Yang and
Kau, after turning over the missive with elevated
noses, expressive of their contempt, cast it from them
with scorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Heigh!</span> the academician Ho thinks to cheat us
with bubbles! He sends us a scrawl devoid of meaning,
to bespeak our favor for an upstart without degree
or title! Yes—<span class='it'>we will remember the name of
Lí!</span>” Saying which, they cast looks of bitter disdain
upon the needy scholar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then commenced the tedious formula of the examination.
The candidates, hundreds in number,
were all obliged to undergo the strict search of the
officers in attendance. Their robes, pockets, shoes,
and even their nicely <a id='plait2'></a>plaited queues were examined,
to see they had not secreted some essay or composition
of some kind, which they might substitute for
one written on the spot without preparation, when
the examiners should command them. This done,
they were all seated on long benches with their paper
and pencils ready for the trial—the doors and windows
in the meanwhile being closely barred and
guarded, that no one from without should have the
power of smuggling any written paper into the hands
of the students.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a signal-gun the theme for composition was
given out, and, like the velvet feet of butterflies, the
pencils of the rival candidates glided smoothly and
fleetly over the tinted paper. With perfect composure
and ease, Lí wrote off his essay in the most
beautiful characters, without a single erasure or
omission—handling the subject with great skill and
judgment, and gave it into the hands of Yang.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Heigh!</span>” said Yang, without giving himself
even the trouble to glance over it, but drawing his
pencil derisively over the fair and beautiful characters,
“I remember the name of Lí! What stuff is
here—why the fellow is only fit to grind my ink!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To grind your ink!” quoth Kau, “say rather he
is only fit to lace my buskins!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>
And laughing loudly at their own wit, the great
judges Yang and Kau turned their backs upon the
unfortunate Lí.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Overwhelmed with mortification and rage, he
rushed to the lower end of the hall, and there was
obliged to remain until evening, as not until then
could the doors be thrown open to give egress to any
one. Here he had the vexation of listening to the
jibes and sneers of those around him, and of seeing
others promoted to honors, who were as far inferior
to him as owls to eagles! What a bitter day for
poor Lí! and when at length dismissed with renewed
contumely from the Scientific Halls, he rushed into
the presence of Ho, swearing loudly that he would
one day ride over the necks of the proud Yang and
Kau, “and by the head of Confucius when I do—<span class='it'>Yang
shall grind my ink, and Kau lace up my
buskins!</span>” he cried with bitterness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ho was terribly indignant at the treatment of his
<span class='it'>protégé</span>, as well as incensed for the insult he imagined
his own dignity had received. But, although
he was himself high in favor with the emperor,
Yang and Kau stood still higher, therefore he dissembled
his anger, lest his head might pay the forfeit,
should those two powerful courtiers incense the emperor
against him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he found Lí preparing to return home, he
embraced him kindly, and bade him tarry yet another
year in the capital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the end thou wilt surely succeed, O Lí. The
next year the examiners will not be the same, and
thou may’st then be certain of success,” said Ho.
“Remain with me until the time comes round—thy
days and nights shall roll off bright and rosy as morning
clouds—wine, wit, and music, yes, and the
smiles of women, shall make thee forget the insults
thou hast received.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Lí remembered his aged mother, sitting solitary
in her humble home by the side of the lake, and
his resolution strengthened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know, O Ho, that an old mother waits for Lí
afar off. Summer and harvest will come, but Whanki
has no one to sow her rice, and desolation will sit in
her dwelling. The fish sport and gambol amid the
waters of the lake—Whanki has no strength to draw
them forth, therefore hunger and death will await
her! What profit, O wise Ho, should I gain if my
aged parent suffered! Would not the gods curse the
race of Lí!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Noble youth, take this purse—it is heavy,” exclaimed
Ho—“hasten to relieve the necessities of
thy mother—a happy mother in so dutiful a son—then
return without delay and await the examination.
I promise thee, thou shalt not this time lack a present
for the greedy judges—though, by Budha, I
would like to give it them at the dagger’s point!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly Lí bade farewell to his generous
friend, promising to return as speedily as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within the “Tranquil Palace of Heaven,” Hwant-sung
sat upon the Dragon’s Throne, with all his
court prostrate before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was evidently “something rotten in the
state of Denmark,” for the clouds which veiled the
august features of the Celestial Monarch were black
as night—thunder might soon be expected, and low
in the dust his humble courtiers awaited the outpouring
of his terrible wrath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before his footstool knelt the Premier Yang, bearing
in his hand an official document inscribed with
curious hieroglyphics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By my ancestors,” exclaimed the emperor, with
a wrathful look from one to the other of his trembling
courtiers, “a wise court is sustained by the
bounty of Hwant-sung! say rather a pack of idiots,
asses, dolts, fatted dogs! What! shall we become a
jibe in the mouths of foreign nations! Shall barbarian
kings mock the court of Nankin! <span class='it'>Hi!</span> Is
there not one then of my learned counsellors—not
one of my renowned warriors can decipher me this
scroll! Tremble, then, ye hounds! Yang, I command
thee to make known to us the purport of the
missive which the foreign ambassadors have brought
to our court.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this order well might Yang turn pale—for there
was no more meaning to him in the characters on
which his eyes were fixed, than in the slimy trail
which the green lizard draws upon the sand. Over
and over he turned it—now on this side, now on that—watched
narrowly and jealously meanwhile by all
around—for when was one high in favor with princes
also the favorite with the mass! At length, nine
times reverently knocking his head before Hwant-sung,
Yang said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let not the displeasure of Earth’s Glory, before
whose frown the whole world stands affrighted, annihilate
his slave that the gods have not granted him
power to do the will of his majesty in this thing.
He cannot read.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then did Hwant-sung call up one after another of
those whose scholastic lore was famed throughout
the empire. In vain. Not one could understand the
mysterious scroll. At which, becoming exceeding
wroth, Hwant-sung swore that unless within three
days his ministers could make known to him the signification
of the embassy, their <span class='it'>offices</span> and <span class='it'>salaries</span>
should all be taken from them—and if in six days
they were still in ignorance, their <span class='it'>death</span> should release
the empire from so many stupid owls!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then did the academician Ho humbly present himself
at the foot of the throne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will the emperor deign to open the ears of graciousness
while the humblest of his slaves speaks?
Know then, O mighty sovereign, there arrived last
night at my house a man in whom all knowledge
seems to centre. His mind, keen as the lightning,
penetrates the most hidden mysteries—there is no
science, no art, which he hath not already mastered.
Command then that he appear before thee to make
plain that which doth perplex thy majesty’s servants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hwant-sung rejoiced greatly at this information,
and bade Ho bring the learned scholar at once into
his presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>
But when Ho, eager with joy, related to Lí the
good fortune he had secured him, that audacious
youth positively refused compliance with the commands
of the emperor! offering as an excuse, that as
he was but a poor scholar, without title or degree, he
dared not presume to appear before so much majesty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this answer then the unhappy Ho returned to
the palace, not doubting but the rage of Hwant-sung
would vent itself not only upon Lí, but also upon
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kneeling before the monarch, Ho exclaimed reverently—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will your majesty once more graciously listen.
At the last examination, this man of whom I have
spoken was turned from the Scientific Halls in disgrace—his
essay rejected by the Premier Yang and
the General Kau. Will it then please thee to bestow
some favor upon Lí, that he may with more propriety
come into this august presence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shall be done,” exclaimed the emperor. “We
confer upon Lí the title of Doctor of the first degree,
together with the purple robe and yellow girdle. Go
bring him before us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this mark of royal patronage, Ho retraced
his steps with all the alacrity of a lover, and made
known to Lí the gracious favors of the emperor, supposing,
doubtless, that the student would rejoice as
one long blind now suddenly restored to light, or as
a famished man at a feast. But lo! coolly putting
on the robes of office, as if he had but just cast them
aside, with the air of a prince, Lí signified to the
great academician Ho his readiness now to obey the
mandate of the emperor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Entering the hall of audience with all the grace and
ease of a man bred in courts, Lí advanced to the
throne, and after paying the customary homage, rose
to his feet and looked proudly around upon the
assembly of grave men and gallant courtiers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The knees of the Premier Yang smote each other,
as he recognized the youth he had treated with so
much contumely now suddenly brought into notice—and
well did Kau now <span class='it'>remember the name of Lí</span>—and
it seemed as if hot pins tore his flesh, into such
agitation did that name now throw him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hwant-sung received the new doctor with condescension,
and placed in his hand the document which
he was required to make plain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Lí, casting a meaning glance upon Yang and
Kau, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can an indifferent scholar like myself presume
to know more than these learned men! Know, O
mighty emperor, thy servant was deemed unworthy
of favor by thy commissioners Yang and Kau—surely,
then, they must be more wise than Lí.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charmed with the boldness of the youth, the emperor
graciously smiled upon him, and motioned the
two mortified examiners to withdraw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then standing erect, his head thrown back, yet in
an attitude of careless ease, Lí opened the important
missive, and without even glancing his eye over it
to understand more fully its nature, read it aloud
from beginning to end, in a clear, melodious voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It proved to be a demand from the king of Po-Hai,
couched in the most insulting language, requiring
the emperor to restore a part of Corea, consisting of
no less than a hundred and eighty towns, and also
demanding tribute from the time of its “<span class='it'>usurpation</span>”
(as the memorial expressed it) by the Emperor of the
Tang Dynasty. Thus, but for the skill of Lí, the
empire would have been plunged in irretrievable
disgrace through the ignorance of its ministers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The countenance of Hwant-sung grew black as
midnight as he listened to this insulting claim, and
but for the bold remonstrance of Lí, he would have
ordered the bearers of the embassy to instant death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May it please your majesty to summon the boorish
ambassadors before us,” cried Lí boldly, “I will
myself confer with them, and teach them how to respect
the mighty Emperor Hwant-sung.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately, therefore, the ambassadors were
brought before Lí, who conversed with them in their
own language with the same haughty bearing as if
he himself were emperor, interpreting as he did so
to the indignant Hwant-sung. At length Lí dismissed
them, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow his sovereign majesty, to whom
your prince is but an earth-worm, will indite an
answer to your insulting embassy. Retire—and
tremble as ye walk! Thank the gods that the gracious
emperor deigns ye to live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The audience chamber rang with acclamation, as
the ambassadors obsequiously withdrew in compliance
to the orders of Lí, and all the courtiers pressed
forward to compliment the young doctor—while the
emperor, embracing him, conferred upon him at
once the rank of academician, and ordered apartments
to be prepared for him in the palace of the
Golden Bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With continued graciousness, he also directed a
sumptuous banquet to be got in readiness, and at
which all the learned men and wits of the court were
expected to appear. Wine was poured for the guests
by beautiful young girls of the “<span class='it'>golden lilies</span>”<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a>—ravishing
music swept around them, while at intervals
of the feast, the emperor sent from his own
apartments a choice theatrical corps for their entertainment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now did it seem that all the trials of Lí were over,
his poverty but a dream long past, and that now
upon the pinnacle to which his ambition had pointed
from early youth, he stood ready to hurl back in the
teeth of his enemies the disgrace which, only a few
months before, they had heaped upon the name of Lí.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The feast wore on even into the night—the wine
circulated freely, and in the same breath the courtiers
exalted the name of the emperor and of the young
academician. What wonder that under the attendance
of such charming cup-bearers Lí should have
drank more freely than was consistent with his new
dignity! How from such hands could he resist the
tempting goblet!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result was, that when the next morning the
emperor repaired to the Hall of Audience to treat
with the embassy from Po-Hai, the academician Lí
was not in attendance—nay, did not make his appearance
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>
until after being twice summoned by royal
mandate!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The courtiers <a id='with'></a>with whom Lí had feasted the night previous,
shook their heads and looked significant. The
Premier Yang and the General Kau resumed their
usual boldness of demeanor, for no doubt this upstart,
this vagabond Lí, would find the anger of their
Celestial Monarch more than his head was worth—decapitation
would certainly follow such contempt
of royalty!</p>

<p class='pindent'>To be <span class='it'>twice</span> summoned—what audacity!</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length Li walked carelessly into the hall—his
dress somewhat disordered, and his feet thrust negligently
into slippers. But for those who were hoping
his ruin, what rage to see the emperor not only extend
his own royal hand in signification that he
would raise him from the ground, but also condescend
to inquire after his health!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think, learned doctor, the wine was to thy
fancy, yet methinks the fumes are still troubling
thee! Ere we proceed to our public duties I would
have thy wits clearer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saying which, Hwant-sung ordered a plate of hot-spiced
fish-broth to be brought from the royal kitchens,
that its effects might dissipate the evils of last night’s
debauch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when with unprecedented condescension their
sovereign even took the chop-sticks, and himself
cooled it for the palate of Lí, amazement almost
turned them to marble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When his majesty deemed the senses of his new
favorite sufficiently restored, the ambassadors were
summoned into the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the top of the platform, near the foot of the
“Dragon’s Throne,” was placed, by the order of
Hwant-sung, a cushion or divan of the Imperial
Yellow, embroidered with gold and silver, and upon
a tablet formed of mother-of-pearl, and richly set in
a band of emeralds, was a cake of perfumed ink—a
sheet of flowery paper—a hair-pencil set in a gold
tube, together with a small <span class='it'>jade</span> stone, with which
to rub the ink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Waving his hand condescendingly to Lí, the emperor
spoke: “Ascend the platform, learned doctor,
and repose thyself upon the cushions at my feet,
while I indite to thee our answer to these slaves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May it please your majesty,” replied Lí, “my
feet are not in proper dress to approach so near the
‘Glory of the Earth.’ Will it please thee to command
new buskins to be brought thy servant, that he
may with decency ascend the platform.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This bold request was no sooner proffered than it
was granted. And then, with a significant glance to
the spot where stood Yang and Kau, pale with rage
and envy, the audacious Lí again addressed the
emperor:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The humblest of thy slaves would not be officious—but
he has one more request to lay at the feet of
his gracious sovereign. At the examination this
year, thy servant was repulsed by Yang, and turned
from the Scientific Halls in disgrace by Kau! Will
it therefore please thee to command the Premier Yang
to <span class='it'>grind my ink</span>, and the General Kau to <span class='it'>lace my
buskins</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never, perhaps, was an audience-chamber so insulted!
Even the awe which, in the presence of the
Celestial Monarch, rendered the courtiers less men
than jackals, failed in this case to suppress a murmur
of indignation which passed from one end of the hall
to the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Hwant-sung, well pleased to punish the injustice
of his commissioners, immediately ordered
them both to approach and do the bidding of Lí!</p>

<p class='pindent'>To disobey was death. They wanted courage to
die, therefore preferring disgrace, they obsequiously
advanced. Kneeling, <span class='it'>Kau laced the buskins of
Lí</span>, who then ascended the platform, and while reclining
at his ease upon the soft cushion at the feet
of the emperor, Yang stood at his side <a id='ass'></a>assiduously
<span class='it'>rubbing his ink</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus did Lí accomplish his revenge, and triumph
over his enemies!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking the pencil, he now, with rapid and easy
strokes, proceeded to indite the answer, which the
emperor vouchsafed to the Po-Hai embassy, and
while he did so, Hwant-sung bent over him in astonishment,
beholding the characters which he traced
with so much rapidity to be identical with those
which had so perplexed his court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then standing erect upon the right hand of the
“Dragon’s Throne,” in clear distinct tones, Lí read
aloud the imperial answer—the ambassadors trembling
with fear as they listened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now return,” exclaimed Lí, “and teach
your king that foxes may not war with lions, nor the
cuckoo steal into the eagle’s nest! He is like a
vexed grasshopper striving to combat the mighty
chariot about to crush him, or like a fly in the jaws
of the dragon! When the mighty Hwant-sung, at
whose name fear sits in the hearts of all nations, shall
send a handful of men to seize upon the petty territory
of Po-Hai, blood shall flow a thousand <span class='it'>li</span>!”<a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Kneeling reverently before the throne, and knocking
their heads in token of submission, the ambassadors
then withdrew to relate to their king that the
“Celestial Empire was upheld by an Immortal from
the skies!” who stood ever by the throne of the
Dragon, and to whom all men did reverence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that day the star of Lí was in the ascendent,
and for many years he enjoyed the undivided confidence
of the emperor, and attained a rank in the
scale of letters, which renders the name of Lí celebrated
in Chinese literature. Many volumes of his
beautiful poems and other works are still preserved
in the Imperial Libraries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Gillespie and his daughter had retired below
when the sweeps were gotten out, and had now returned
to the deck. Unconscious of danger, they
looked admiringly upon the shining and beautiful
scene. Nearly abreast the island of Porto Rico, in
full view, lay basking in the beams of the setting
sun, the dark, rich green of its luxuriant growth of
cane, here and there varied by groves of the cotton-tree,
amid which were seen clustering the settlements
of the planters. Astern, but farther distant,
Cape Engano stretched far to seaward, while inland,
ridge over ridge, wooded to their summits, rose the
picturesque mountains of St. Domingo. The numerous
vessels in sight, mostly running before the wind,
varying in size, in rig, and in the color of their canvas,
enlivened the view, while nearer, the frigate in
her towering proportions was borne majestically toward
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Edward! what a glorious sight!” said the
maiden to her lover, who had stepped to her side, as
she gained the deck. “Look, father! look at that
splendid ship, doesn’t she cleave the waters ‘like a
thing of life?’ But what is the matter, Edward?
You are silent, and seem dejected, do tell me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a moment, dearest,” he whispered, as he left
her to approach the captain, who had beckoned to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Talbot,” said the last, “my little craft is in
great peril, and less than an hour must decide her
fate. The Spaniard will not be silent much longer,
and I advise you to get the passengers below.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was about to propose it,” replied Talbot, and
returning to Miss Gillespie’s side, said, “summon
your fortitude, Mary, the ship which you admire so
much, is a Spanish frigate, and is endeavoring to
capture the vessel we are in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how unfortunate! and will they harm us?
Can they hurt you and father and Frank? Good God!
what is that?” and she shrieked as the ship luffed to
the wind, and fired a shot, which went plunging
across the bows of the schooner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come below, dearest! come quickly! Help me,
Mr. Gillespie, for she has nearly fainted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maiden and her father were conducted to the
most secure place below, when, resisting the entreaties
of his mistress, Talbot returned to the deck,
which Frank had refused to leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the first report of the frigate’s gun, the captain
had called out, “Edge her away, quarter-master,
keep her off a point; let the guns alone,” he added,
addressing some of the crew, “let them be, it would
be worse than useless to fire them—the ‘Bird’ must
now trust to her wings alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little vessel was in fact at the very crisis of
her fate. The last shot had told that they were
within reach of the guns of the enemy; they felt
that their only avenue of escape was through a
gauntlet of fire, and that the loss of a single spar
would certainly insure their capture. It seemed perfect
madness for such a wee thing to abide the wrath
of the huge leviathan, panoplied in thunder, and possessing
almost the power of annihilation. But, in
the forlorn and desperate hope of sustaining the
enemy’s fire for a few moments, without material
injury her captain steadily pursued his way, but cut
his anchors from the bow, and threw four of his guns
overboard. If the wind had been light, the schooner’s
chance would have been a fair one; but the breeze
instead of lulling, seemed to freshen as the sun went
down. As it was, however, there was a bare possibility
of escape, for already the little vessel, lightened
of so much weight, began to increase her velocity—still
there was an abiding, a stunning fear of
being sunk or disabled by the broadside of the frigate.
The latter had already opened her fire, and near the
chase, the fierce, iron hail had fairly lashed the water
into foam, but the schooner was yet materially unharmed,
when a voice more potent than that of gunpowder,
hushed the loud artillery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unobserved by either, a light and fleecy speck,
more like a wift of smoke than a fragment of a cloud,
had risen over the land, and swift as a meteor shot
across the sky. It was what sailors term a “white
squall,” and it had caught the chaser and the chased
wholly unprepared. Almost simultaneously it struck
them both. The frigate's fore-mast and main-topmast
went by the board, and every sail that was set, was
blown into perfect shreds. The “Humming Bird,”
light and resistless, felt the blast but to succumb before
it—she was whirled over and capsized in an instant.
A number of the crew, entangled in the sails
and rigging were immediately drowned. The remainder
clambered to the upper-rail, to which they
clung with the tenacity that endangered life. In a
paroxysm of anguish, Talbot had thrown himself
down the cabin-hatchway as he felt the vessel going
over, and at imminent hazard had rescued Miss Gillespie,
but her father and the servant-maid perished.
Frank had been saved by one of the seamen, who
held him firmly with one hand, while with the other
he clung to the shrouds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as the survivors were assured of their
immediate safety, they looked around to see if
there were any hopes of being rescued from their
position before the night set in. The frigate had
driven past them, and under a single after-sail was
hove-to, clearing her hull of the wreck. To the westward,
distinct in the reflected light of the sun, which
had descended, were several vessels again unfolding
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>
to the breeze the canvas which they had wisely furled
to the passing gust. Some of the larger ones were
again standing boldly out to seaward, while the others
like affrighted wild-fowl, were hovering toward the
shore. They were all too distant, and the air was
fast becoming too obscure for them to see the wreck,
or the unfortunate beings who were perched upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the first recovery from her swoon, the grief of
Miss Gillespie for the loss of her father was almost
inconsolable. It required all the endearment and
entreaties of her lover and her brother to prevail on
her to struggle against the spasms which threatened
her very existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The survivors strove to cheer each other, but the
indiscreet cry of one that he saw the fin of a shark
cleaving the surface of the water, led them to fear
that they were environed by yet greater peril. In
about two hours the moon arose, and her clear, chaste
light silvered the crests of the waves, as they curled
to the now gentle breeze. She had risen scarce more
than her diameter, when the watchers on the wreck
discovered two or three dark objects which seemed
to creep upon the water. Their hopes and their
fears were equally excited, but presently they heard
the splash of oars, and they knew them to be boats
from the frigate. As eager now to be taken as before
to escape from capture, by shouts and cries they attracted
the notice of those who sought them. They
were soon removed to the frigate; the lady and her
brother being led to the cabin, and the remainder, including
Talbot, promiscuously confined on the lower
deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under jury-foremast and new main-topmast, the
frigate was the next morning standing under easy
sail, along the southern side of St. Domingo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Repeatedly but ineffectually Talbot had endeavored
to convey a message to Miss Gillespie, and spent
the night in sleepless anxiety on her account. He
knew not into whose hands she had fallen, and
whether her youth and beauty might not, in the hands
of unprincipled men, tempt to ruffianly treatment.
Her brother was with her, it was true, but although
spirited, he was young and feeble compared to the
strong men around him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early in the morning, Talbot had asked to see the
officer of the watch. He was told that he could not
communicate with any one but through the officer
of the marine guard, who would not make the rounds
for three or four hours. Talbot impatiently waited
for him, and it seemed an age before he made his
appearance. When he did so, and was told that
Talbot wished to speak to him, he superciliously
asked, “Well, sir, what do you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish,” replied Talbot, “to communicate through
you to the commander of this ship, that I hold a commission
as lieutenant in the navy of the United States,
and that with the family of Mr. Gillespie, I was a
passenger on board of the privateer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a singular tale,” remarked the other, incredulously;
“have you any proofs of your identity—where
is your commission?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I <a id='have'></a>haven’t it; with all my baggage, it was, unhappily,
lost in the schooner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This seems incredible,” said the officer, “your
dress, too, does not indicate the position you claim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am aware of it,” replied Talbot, “for I scrupulously
avoided wearing any part of my uniform, that
in appearance even, I might not be classed among
the complement of that unfortunate vessel. But here
is her commander, who, as well as his crew, will
bear testimony to what I say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let them answer for themselves,” was the abrupt
reply. “If they escape being hung as pirates, they
will fare well.” After a moment’s hesitation, he
added, “I will state what you say to Count Ureña,
our commander, although I do not myself believe it;
but let me advise you not to rely upon the evidence
of these wretches,” pointing to the prisoners, “if you
have no other proof you will fare badly.” As he said
this, he turned upon his heel and walked away,
Talbot with difficulty restraining himself from throttling
him for his coarse, unfeeling rudeness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, hour after hour passed away in fruitless
anxiety. Every step upon the ladder which led from
above, exciting a thrill of hope, only the instant after
to be crushed in bitter disappointment. At length,
about 2 P.M., an orderly, with a file of marines came
to conduct him to the commander. With alacrity he
obeyed the summons, and when he reached the gun-deck,
from habits of association, he felt cheered at
the sight of the long lines of massive artillery, the
stacks of muskets here and there, surmounted with
their bristling bayonets, and the bright sheen of the
sharpened cutlases. As the cabin-door was thrown
open by the sentry stationed there, he cast a quick
and searching glance around the apartment, in the
hope of seeing his betrothed. She was not there,
and but for the guns projecting from either side, he
could not have realized that he stood in the cabin of
a man-of-war, so rich was its furniture and so gorgeous
its decorations. Gracefully festooned across
its entire width, and partially concealing the white
and highly polished lattice-work of the after-cabin,
was a deep curtain of crimson embroidered and
fringed with gold. On either side, in the recesses
between the guns, were magnificent couches canopied
and covered with the same material, intertwined
with white. Between the forward and the after gun,
on each side, were collections of flowers and fragrant
plants. A large mirror in an arabesque frame, was
inclined over a rose-wood sideboard, laden with
massive plate and a profusion of crystal. A richly
chased silver lamp was suspended over a table, the
cover of which was of white cloth, like the curtain,
fringed with gold. Around were a few rose-wood
chairs, and from several cages were heard the cheerful
and melodious notes of canary-birds. The deck was
covered with the finest matting. On the couch, in the
recess to the left, was seated a man of middle age and
rather delicate features, except the chin and under
lip, which were massive and sensual, and a peculiar
glance of the eye, which gave a sinister aspect to an
otherwise singularly handsome countenance. He
was spare in figure, and to a casual observer, even as
he sat, it was perceptible that he stooped, and his
whole appearance indicated a frequent participant
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>
in the orgies of dissipation. Before him stood the
officer of marines, who had just made his official report.
At a signal from the latter, Talbot advanced
toward the count, who said, “I understand, sir, from
the officer of the guard, that you declare yourself to
be a lieutenant in the navy of the United States, but
that you have no evidence to sustain you. How can
you expect me to credit the assertion of a stranger
under such suspicious circumstances as you must admit
your present position to be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a lady on board, sir, my affianced
bride, who, with her brother, is here under the same
circumstances with myself, they will tell you that I
am not an impostor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your affianced bride,” said the count, not heeding
what he had last said, “you are then the friend for
whom she has been so restless and uneasy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew that she would be so,” replied Talbot;
“may I ask now to see her, that she may corroborate
what I have said?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so fast,” exclaimed the count, “that you
have gained the affections of the young lady is no
proof of your being what you profess, indeed, you
may have won them under an assumed name and
character.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ill becomes you, sir,” cried Talbot, highly incensed,
“it ill becomes you to insult a man who for
the time being is in your power; but I warn you that
if I, or those with me, are unnecessarily detained or
harshly treated, you will be held to a severe accountability.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And by whom, sir,” exclaimed the count, turning
pale with rage, “by a man who has no <a id='other'></a>other vouchers
to a most improbable tale, than a horde of pirates, a
mere boy, and a love-sick maiden?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The proofs are sufficient, sir, for any impartial
mind, but I see plainly that you have some purpose
in seeming to disbelieve them—what that purpose is
your conscience best can tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What mean you, sir, by this insolence; but I
know how to curb and to punish it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Insolence! and punish!” contemptuously answered
Talbot, “those are words used by cowards
when addressing slaves. I defy alike your malice
and your power. You may maltreat me, but a day
of reckoning will surely come. I demand to see
Miss Gillespie and her brother,” he added, as his ear
caught the sound of stifled sobs in the after cabin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The count pulled a bell-rope by his hand, and at
the summons, the sentry who had admitted him,
opened the door and looked in, while from another
door, the steward entered and stood obsequiously by
his master. The latter, pointing to the door, said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Manuel, take out your prisoner and confine
him apart from the rest; sentry, let them pass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Talbot hesitated a moment, and then said, “I am
unarmed and helpless, and it would therefore be
madness to resist you—but, in the name of humanity,
I ask you, can you listen unmoved to the distress of
the unhappy lady within there; as a man, an officer,
and a nobleman, I appeal to you in her behalf. She
has recently lost her father, as you know, and, save
myself, her young brother is now her only protector.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She will be sufficiently protected, sir, without
your interference—take out the prisoner, Mr. Manuel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The above conversation had taken place in Spanish,
which Talbot spoke fluently, but when he found that
for some sinister purpose, he was not to be permitted
to see Miss Gillespie, he advanced toward the lattice-work
and called out in English, “Mary, dear Mary,
be upon your guard! Frank, do not leave your
sister for a moment; I fear that she is in the hands of
a villain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I will not,” cried the boy, who vainly tried
to force the door, while his sister sobbed convulsively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The count, who, although not understanding the
language, comprehended the import of the words,
with a gesture of frantic impatience, motioned the
officer to lead his prisoner away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Talbot, satisfied that the danger was lessened by
the timely warning he had given, without resistance,
submitted to be led from the apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When left alone, the count remained for some
time in a thoughtful attitude. “If I could but speak
their horrid language,” he said, soliloquizing with
himself, “or if she understood mine, I should certainly
succeed, for as to this would-be bridegroom,
I can easily get rid of him, and of the brother also,
if he prove intractable. Let me see! can I trust
Gonzalez? From the expression of his eye sometimes,
as well as from his never speaking of her, I
fear that he knows all about his unhappy sister; and
yet I must trust him, or abandon all, for he is the
only interpreter we have. There is no help for it;
I cannot give up the game so freshly started—but I
will be wary and watch him closely.” He slightly
touched the bell, “Send Gonzalez to me,” he said to
the attendant, who obeyed the summons. A few
moments after, a young man of 23 or 24 years of
age entered the apartment, and bowing to the count,
awaited his commands in silence. From his spare
figure, he looked taller than he really was. His hair
and moustaches were glossy black, curling in their
rich luxuriance. His eye-brows, thick and bushy,
formed one continuous arch, and the eye beneath,
black and lustrous, was soft and subdued in its ordinary
expression, but at times, in a single glance,
would convey a startling idea of latent but indomitable
energy. His features were almost femininely
regular, and his voice musically clear and sweet.
The count’s fears were not without foundation; his
secretary, for such was the position of Gonzalez,
knew his sister’s wrongs, and like a true Spaniard,
thirsted for an opportunity to revenge them. His
commander scanned him closely where he stood for
some minutes, the young man at first returning his
gaze with a look neither too humble, nor yet audacious,
and then deferentially turned his eyes in another
direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter, Gonzalez? You seem of
late unusually taciturn and moody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think, señor, that my health is suffering from
long confinement to the ship. I need recreation on
shore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>
“What mean you by long confinement—were you
not on shore repeatedly last month in Havana?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, señor! If you will recollect, I applied
several times to go, but on each occasion you had
important letters or despatches to write.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you hear from home before we sailed?” and
the count’s look became intensely riveted upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man slightly colored, “I heard indirectly,
señor, that all were well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From whom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From a muleteer who resides in the adjoining
village.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he give you any particulars?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None, señor, worth relating.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The count paused. He was dissatisfied, yet feared
that by further questioning he might excite the very
suspicions he wished to repress. Assuming a bland
and conciliatory tone, he said, “I have been to blame,
Gonzalez, and will make amends. When we reach
port, you shall have ample opportunities to recruit
on shore. Should you need funds, consider my
purse at your service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, señor! my salary is more than sufficient
for all my wants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, should you be in need, remember my
offer; but come nearer, I have now something confidential
to impart. You are aware that the lady
brought on board last night is now in the after-cabin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am, señor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of the prisoners, doubtless an impostor, assumes
that she is his betrothed. I wish you to see
her and ascertain how she is affected toward him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is needless, señor. At the invitation of Lieutenant
Flores, I accompanied him in his boat last
night, and in rescuing the prisoners from the wreck,
witnessed how tenderly that lady clung to the man
you speak of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may have been the convulsiveness of fear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If so, señor, it would have subsided with the
occasion that gave it birth; but it continued to the
last, and while she evinced for the lad the solicitude
of an elder sister, she seemed to regard the American
as her chosen and sole protector.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How were they separated?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understood, señor, by your orders,” replied the
youth with an air of surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean,” said the count, somewhat confused,
“how did they bear it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was at first disposed to resist, but a moment
after submitted with an air of stern resignation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She at first seemed bewildered, and could not
comprehend the purport of the order; when she did
so, she implored her lover, for such he must be, not
to desert her, but after he had whispered a few words
to her, she too submitted, and with such meek gentleness
as moved the hardest hearts to sympathy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sympathy,” exclaimed the count, reddening;
“where there is no real distress, there can be no occasion
for its exercise. In common humanity, I am
bound to protect her from the acts of an impostor.”
There was a slight twitch of the secretary’s upper
lip, but he said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At all events, I wish you to converse with her,
Gonzalez. Try if you cannot reconcile her to a
short separation from her lover, and assure her that
as soon as I am satisfied that he is what he represents
himself, he shall be free.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The secretary bowed in acquiescence, and the
count rising, led the way into the after-cabin. It
was fit for the boudoir of a queen. A carpet of the
richest Persian dyes and softest texture was under
foot. Except in front, the whole apartment was
lined with fawn-colored tapestries; the windows
framed into the after ports had party-colored curtains
of fawn and cherry colors. An ottoman and several
chairs were covered with embroidered damask corresponding
to the tapestry; a small, richly-carved
book-case was filled with handsomely bound books.
There was a pair of globes upon stands, and a harp,
a guitar, mirrors and candelabra, with a few small
but exquisite paintings completed the equipment of
this cell of a Sybarite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With disheveled hair, and eyes inflamed with
weeping, in all the abandonment of grief, Miss Gillespie
lay with her head upon her brother’s breast,
who, as the door was opened, threw his arms around,
as if more perfectly to protect her. With a courteous
air, and all the finished breeding of an artificial gentleman,
the count advanced and paid his respects
through the medium of the interpreter. “Had she
sustained no injury from the accident of the night
before? Had she recovered from her alarm?
Had she slept well? Could he do any thing for
her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three first questions she answered in monosyllables.
At the fourth, she made an effort to speak,
but maiden bashfulness overcame her, and she looked
imploringly to her brother. The youth construed
her feelings rightly, and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We wish, sir, to see our friend, Mr. Talbot, who
was, with us, a passenger in the schooner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At present it cannot be,” answered the count,
“but when we reach Havana, he will doubtless prove
his character, and then you can be again united,
but,” addressing her, “so much beauty should not
be marred by untimely grief. A few days more and
your friend will be restored to liberty. Here I
cannot make any distinction between him and the
other prisoners. Let me therefore entreat you, Miss,
to dry up your tears, and let a smile once more
wreath itself upon your lovely cheek.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say to him,” asked Miss G., of the interpreter,
“that I am in deep affliction. Yesterday I lost my
father, and now, when I am most helpless, I am by
his act,” (she looked toward the count) “separated
from the friend whom that father had chosen as my
protector through life. I am therefore in no mood to
listen to compliments, which would be ill-timed from
any one, most of all from him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The count stifled his vexation and said, “I beg
pardon for this intrusion. I will await a more seasonable
time to express my sympathy and make a
proffer of my services;” so saying, he withdrew,
desiring Gonzalez to remain and gather the particulars
of their history.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
An unprincipled man, in his sphere possessing
almost unlimited power, he felt himself baffled by an
unarmed prisoner and a helpless maid. “Till now,”
he said to himself, “I thought Dolores beautiful, but
her features want the intellectual grace and harmony
of this northern houri. At all hazards, she must be
mine. If all else fails, the drug must be resorted to.
It is certainly the speediest and I know not but that
it is the best; but I am neglecting my first precaution.”
He rung the bell for the steward, a dark, swarthy
Italian, with the body of a man surmounted on the
legs of a dwarf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Domingo,” said his master, “go into the secret
passage and watch Gonzalez, who is now with the
lady. Note every thing that he does, and try to
gather the meaning of what he says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The steward obeying, disappeared through a panel
that opened with a spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In about half an hour, Gonzalez came forth from
the inner cabin, and stated what he had learned of the
prisoners, which, as there was no concealment, is
precisely what is known to the reader. When he had
retired, at a peculiar signal from the count, the panel
noiselessly flew open, and the steward reappeared before
his master. His account was any thing but
satisfactory, and the count’s brow was darkened
with deep mistrust, as he listened to the recital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About sunset, Miss Gillespie, aroused by some incentive,
sent to ask if her brother and herself might
be permitted to walk on the upper deck. Assent
was most graciously given, and the count himself
escorted her. Finding that she would not converse,
and that his presence was evidently irksome to her,
he smothered his chagrin, and after a few turns, left
the orphans to themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an hour and a scene fitted to captivate the
eye and refresh the soul; and such was its soothing
influences, that Miss G. frequently found her mind
wandering from the contemplation of the perils which
environed her. The night previous, the ship, driven
before the blast, was whirled with resistless velocity
along a bed of seething foam. Now, the gentle wind
borne from the land, wafted fragrance on its wing,
and the sea, slightly ruffled, seemed to enjoy the refreshing
embrace of its sister element; the ship, too,
under a cloud of canvas, snow-white and full distended,
pressed majestically on, the spray, like fairy
fret-work curling and combing beneath the bow and
the rippling wake sparkled in the rays of the setting-sun.
The gorgeous western sky was tinged with
the hues of crimson and gold; the south was a boundless
expanse of blue, the island of St. Domingo, lofty,
picturesque and beautiful, bounded the northern and
eastern horizon. The land, but little cultivated,
seemed fertile in the extreme, and was covered with
lofty and umbrageous trees, the tangled and luxuriant
undergrowth seeming so interlaced as even at high
noon to <a id='inter'></a>intercept the light of the sun. The near
mountains were covered to their very summits with
verdure, not the tawny verdure of a northern clime,
but the brilliant green of the tropics, while the loftier
mountains wreathed their bald and craggy tops with
the clouds that floated in the distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun had gone down and the moon was up:
still Miss Gillespie paced the deck with her brother.
It was evident that she had some purpose in view,
and by those who watched her, she was observed to
cast frequent and furtive glances around. At length
a figure that had been stealthily gliding along under
the shadow of the bulwarks to leeward, suddenly
stepped beside her, and whispered, “Lady, I have
endeavored to see him, but failed. Some time tonight
I will surely succeed. In the meantime there
is but one resource. Take this powder, and when
you go below, dissolve it, and take a part yourself,
giving the remainder to your brother. If you would
be safe, neither of you should sleep a wink to-night.
Be careful of what you eat or drink. But, hush!
there is a man’s head raised above the rail—he has
been observing us. I must away—but do not forget
this.” He handed a small folded paper as he spoke,
and immediately disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Gillespie had brought a book on deck with
her, and by occasionally seeming to read it, had at
first given a pretext for remaining. Into this book
she inserted the paper, and soon after turned to leave
the deck, when some one brushed rudely against her,
and the book fell. The person, who, in her confusion
she did not recognize, instantly picked it up,
and in seeming eagerness to return it, let it fall a
second time. Frightened almost beside herself, Miss
G. now snatched it up and hurried below. <a id='unfor'></a>Unfortunately,
the paper was not to be found. So dreadful
seemed the fate before her, that with difficulty she
restrained herself from shrieking aloud. Frank
cheered her all he could, although he had but a faint
conception of the danger. They determined to deny
themselves food and liquids of every description,
hoping thereby to avoid the administration of an
opiate. Alas! they knew not the infernal arts of
the demon in human shape, who had them in his
power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening, as was his wont once a week, the
count supped with his officers in the ward-room, and
he remained until near midnight; but in the meantime
his diabolical agent had not been idle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About 11 o’clock Frank and his sister were sensible
that they were inhaling an aromatic and fragrant
vapor. At first they enjoyed it; but it soon occurred
to them that they were fast becoming drowsy. With
desperate exertions they endeavored to force the
doors, or to obtain assistance by their loud and vociferous
outcries. The breeze had unfortunately freshened
on deck, and there was much tramping and
running overhead, so that they were unheard, or if
heard, unheeded. One would suppose that this agitation
and fear would have proved an antidote to the
insidious effects of the drug; but no! gently, imperceptibly,
they felt their systems relax; they soon
began to wonder at their alarm; a delicious langour
enthralled them, and as volume after volume of the
scented vapor rolled into the apartment, they surrendered
themselves to its influence, and pressed
in each other’s arms, were soon wrapped in a profound
and insensible sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About an hour before, Talbot, to whom the night
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>
previous had been a sleepless one, although racked
with anxiety, had fallen into a light and fitful slumber,
when he was instantly aroused by a hand being laid
upon his chest, and a voice whispering in his ear,
“Do not speak, but follow; imitate my motions as
exactly as you can. For God’s sake be cautious, you
know not how much is at stake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The speaker, who was lying beside him on the
deck, then rolled over toward the hatchway; but
when the sentry turned in his round, he remained
perfectly still. This he repeated, slowly and cautiously;
Talbot followed his example, until they
reached what sailor’s term the combings of the main-hatch,
i.e. the elevated pieces around it, to prevent
the water from running into the hold. He there
waited for some time until he saw the sentry loiter at
the furthest end of his round, when he quickly threw
himself down the hatch, and crept on one side out of
sight. As soon as Talbot had done the same, he led
the way among the casks and barrels. When they
had proceeded a little distance, he whispered, “The
master’s-mate of the hold, who is a fellow-townsman
of mine, had this passage opened for me to-day. Had
he refused, and he hesitated for a long time, that
villain in the cabin would inevitably succeed in his
plans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What plans?” eagerly asked Talbot. “I know
not who you are, or whither you are leading me—explain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will soon know me; but let it content you
now that I lead you to save your mistress. But that
I feared the interference of that ruffian, the steward,
I would have gone alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lead on, then! lead quickly!” said Talbot, his
fears strongly excited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They resumed their way, groping along in the
dark, and taking every step with the greatest caution.
In a short while they distinguished the faint light
admitted from the deck above through the fore-hatch.
As soon as they had gained this opening, Gonzalez,
for it was he, taking the opportunity when the sentry
was furthest off, and had his back toward him, sprung
quickly up, and blowing out the light in a lantern
which hung to an upright timber, immediately returned
to Talbot’s side. As was anticipated, the
sentry, supposing the light to have been extinguished
by a flurry of wind, took the lantern down, and proceeded
to the main-hatch, to relight the lamp. As he
did so, they both, unperceived, succeeded in gaining
first the gun and then the upper-deck. Then separating,
each one quietly and undetected reached the
quarter-deck, and again rejoining each other, they
slipped through a port-hole to a narrow platform
outside, called the main-chains, and there, in intense
anxiety, concerted their future movements, for the
most perilous part of their enterprise was yet before
them.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_3'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The convivial party in the ward-room had been
broken up by a squall, and with the other sea-officers,
the count had repaired to the quarter-deck. For a
short time the wind blew with violence, and was succeeded
by a heavy fall of rain. In less than an hour
there was a perfect calm, and the sails flapped sluggishly
against the masts as the ship moved with the
undulations of a light ground-swell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the cabin, the solitary lamp, suspended from a
beam, through the gauze-like vapor shed its soft light
upon the rich and costly furniture, and revealed the
forms of the sleepers, whose deep breathing alone
proclaimed their existence, so immovable was their
position—so much deprived did their bodies seem of
the watchful guardianship of the spirits within them.
The faint and silvery light, the attenuated vapor, the
fragrant odors wafted from the flowers in front, the
boy, with his noble brow undimmed by sin or sorrow,
the lovely maiden, one arm upon her breast, and one
clasped around her brother, formed an atmosphere
and a group in and around which angels might love
to linger. But a serpent had stealthily glided in, and
the count, with maddening pulse and gloating eye,
looked upon his unconscious victim. Incapable of
any feeling but that of a hardened libertine, no thought
of the dire ruin he was about to inflict for one instant
stayed his purpose. As the spider, after weaving its
web, contemplates the struggles of the entangled fly,
before clutching to devour it, so he stood, reveling
in anticipation on the sensual feast before him. At
length he approached, he gently touched, then breathed
upon, and called them by their names, and then
more rudely shook them. As he anticipated, they
neither heard nor heeded him. The stillness was
death-like and profound. He removed the boy from
the girl's embrace, and she lay resistless at his mercy.
For an instant longer he paused; he fondled her hand,
he played with her tresses; he stooped to kiss her
moist and parted lip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fiend-like purpose was frustrated: a crashing
blow descended upon his head, and he rolled over
and fell senseless on the deck. With one foot upon
the prostrate form, and the massive bar again uplifted,
Talbot stood over him, while from the doorway
Gonzales looked on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold!” said the last, as Talbot was about to repeat
the blow, “Hold! another stroke may finish
him, and that is a task reserved for me alone.” He
advanced as he spoke, and proceeded to examine the
wound. “It is a very severe contusion,” he added
a moment after, “and if it had fallen a little more
direct, the blow would have been a fatal one. He is
now wholly insensible, and unless my skill in surgery
fails me, he will remain, for some days at least, in a
perfect stupor. It is most fortunate. We need not
now attempt an escape, for no one can suspect us,
and before he recovers, we shall probably be in Havana.
Let us place him in his room and retire; the
vile, pandering steward will not dare to enter during
the night, and in the morning, I will be hovering near.
It is useless, no human efforts can awake them now,”
he added, as he saw Talbot endeavoring to arouse
the maiden: “but they are safe, and that they may
continue so, we must not lose a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a sigh, Talbot relinquished the hand of his
mistress, which he had clasped within his own, and,
pressing his lips to her fair forehead, turned to assist
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>
Gonzalez in removing the wounded man. They
then effaced all traces of their presence, and retired
as they had come, through the window of the quarter-gallery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning the table in the forward cabin
was spread for breakfast; the steward, in passing to
and fro, grinned leeringly as from time to time he
looked toward the after cabin. One of the midshipmen
of the watch came to report 8 o’clock. The
steward tapped lightly at the state-room door, but
receiving no reply, and not presuming to disturb his
master, took it upon himself to report to the officers
that the count said “Very well”—the usual reply.
By 9 o’clock, he began to be uneasy, not that he apprehended
any thing to have happened to his master,
but that the lady might awake before the count had
left her apartment. At the lattice-work, and to the
key-hole of his master’s door, he alternately placed
his ear. At the last he thought that he distinguished
a deep and smothered breathing; at the first he could
hear no sound whatever. Satisfied that his master
was in his state-room, he felt more easy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At 10 o’clock, the wonted hour, the drum beat to
quarters for inspection. When the first lieutenant
came to make his report, the steward intimated that
the count was indisposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has he directed that he should not be disturbed?”
asked the officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The steward admitted that he had not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you been summoned to him in the night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I must make my report.” He advanced
to the door and knocked, at first gently, and then
louder and more loudly still. There was no reply;
and the officer, turning the bolt, to the surprise of the
steward, the door yielded to his push, and flew open.
(That their mode of entrance might not be suspected,
Gonzalez had unlocked it before retiring.) The
count was found with his wrapper on, lying in a
profound stupor, the blood clotted thickly over the
wound he had received. The orphans were buried
in a sleep which the surgeon pronounced unnatural;
and the steward was suspected of having drugged
them, and afterward attempted the life of his master.
This miserable wretch was thrown in irons as the
supposed murderer of the man in whose contemplated
villainy he had been a willing and a free participant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Light and baffling winds detained the frigate, and
on the evening of the fourth day after the incident
above related, she had just cleared the windward
passage, and with Cape la Mole astern, was standing
along the northern shore of Cuba, for the port of
Havana. The count had laid in a comatose state
since his accident, and his constant heavy breathing
and frequent moans, showed how much pressure
there was upon the brain, and how much he suffered.
In the course of this day his respiration had become
more regular and less oppressive, and about 3 o’clock
in the afternoon, he awoke to consciousness and
a sense of pain. By degrees his recollection returned,
and after making a few inquiries, to the surprise of
every one, he ordered the steward to be released,
and again summoned in attendance upon him. These
two, the master, just rescued from the grave, and
the servant who would have found an ignominious
one had his master died, conferred for a long time
together. After questioning his steward closely, the
count said, “I am satisfied, Domingo, that it was
not from your hand that I received the blow. I left
you in the forward cabin, you could only have entered
on the starboard side, and in that direction my head
was turned, and I must have seen you. The blow
was on the other side—probably from some one
secreted there. Were you at any time absent from
the cabin, after I went to the ward-room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not an instant, señor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is strange! Could he have entered by the
quarter-gallery?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must have been so, señor, although I can discover
no marks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suspect Gonzalez,” said the count; “indeed, I
am sure that he has been concerned, but then he had
not the vigor to deal such a blow. That hateful
American must have been the man. I will be deeply
revenged!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Late that afternoon, as Talbot, sitting aloof from
the other prisoners, was grieving that Mary’s persecutor
had recovered his faculties before the arrival
of the ship in port, and from which he feared the most
serious consequences, he was accosted by the master’s-mate,
who said, in passing, “Courage, my
friend, you will soon be at liberty—take a cigar to
cheer you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Talbot thanked him, and was about to decline,
when he caught the eye of the officer, and noticed
that he pushed a particular one out from the small
bundle he held in his hand; Talbot took it, and watching
his opportunity, opened his cigar unobserved.
It contained a small slip of paper within its folds
with these words. “We are strongly suspected, if
not discovered; I know it from the searching examination
I have undergone. We must fly and reach
Havana before the ship if possible. Be on the alert
for any opportunity that may present to slip up the
main-hatch ladder, near which I will be hovering.
Do not hesitate! Here you are absolutely within the
power of the tyrant. He will throw you into the
Moro Castle as soon as we arrive, and before your
case can be investigated, months must elapse, and
in the meantime, the lady will be lost to you forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This note agitated Talbot exceedingly. It was
agonizing to think of leaving Mary and her brother
in the hands of their unprincipled captor; and yet,
from his own experience thus far, he felt sure, that if
he remained, he would be kept separated from her,
and most probably confined in a dungeon until her
ruin was completed. His only consolation was, that
the count could not recover sufficiently to renew his
nefarious designs before the ship had reached her
port of destination. This consideration determined
him to make his escape if possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There had been some water heated in the coppers,
(anglice—boiler,) for the purpose of giving the count
a prescribed bath. It so happened that while the
cook’s attention was drawn another way, a piece of
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>
meat was thrown in, which rendered the water
greasy and unfit for its destined use. The master’s-mate
was therefore directed to have more drawn
from the hold. Accordingly he came upon the lower
or birth-deck, and as he stepped from the ladder,
said, sufficiently loud for Talbot to hear, who was
reclined beside it, “Look out!” and passed immediately
on. The latter, taking the hint, but uncertain
how to apply it, remained for a few moments in great
suspense, when the master’s-mate called the sentry
forward to hold the light for him. As the latter
moved forward, Talbot availed himself of the opportunity,
and instantly hurried up the ladder, although
yet uncertain if such were the plan concerted by his
friends. He was very soon assured, however, for
nearly abreast of him, from the shadow between two
of the guns, a figure advanced a few steps and immediately
retired again. It proved to be Gonzalez, and
together they clambered out over one of the guns,
and found themselves by the small skiff of the privateer,
which had been saved and hoisted up immediately
under the anchor in the waist. Fortunately,
the wind had hauled nearly ahead, and with the
yards sharp-braced up, the ship was sailing sluggishly
along, with her head rather diagonally inclined
toward the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must remain quiet here,” whispered Gonzalez,
“until some movement be made on deck, in
the noise of which we can lower the skiff undetected.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind was gradually freshening, and the ship
began to plunge with the increasing swell. After a
while the topgallant-sails were taken in, but it was
an operation so quickly performed, that before the
boat was lowered half the distance it was suspended
from the water, the noise ceased, and they were
obliged to hold on. In about half an hour after, which
seemed to them an almost interminable space of time,
they were cheered with the welcome order,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man the main clew-garnets and buntlines,” preparatory
to hauling up the mainsail. As the men
ran away with the ropes, and clued and gathered the
large and loudly flapping sail to the yard, Talbot and
Gonzalez lowered the boat, and casting her loose, the
ship passed by without any one observing them and
was soon lost to view in the obscurity of the night.
They had exchanged apprehended evils from human
malignity for instant and appalling danger. The
moon, struggling through a bank of clouds and shorn
of her brilliancy by the opposing mist, cast her furtive
beams upon the fretted sea. Instead of the prolonged
and easy swell of the mid-ocean, the gulf, as
if moved by adverse tides, whirled its waves about
like some huge Briareus, tossing his hundred arms
in the wildest and most furious contortions. The
skiff was so light, so frail, and so difficult of trim,
that they were every moment in danger of upsetting.
The swell rapidly increased, and as they sunk into
the trough of the sea, and shut out the faint horizon,
the succeeding wave overshadowed, and its crest
seemed to curl in anger above them. Sometimes a
wave, like some monster rising from the deep, looked
down black and threatening upon the tiny boat, and
then rolling its seething foam along the sides, it
rushed ahead, and gathering into a mass, seemed to
await her coming. Thinly clad, and soon wet to the
skin, as they rode upon the tops of the waves, they
suffered bitterly from the coldness of the wind. In the
hollow of the sea, they were sheltered one moment
only to be more exposed the next. Sometimes riding
upon the broken crest of a wave, they felt upon their
bed of foam, as insignificant and far more helpless
than the gulls which, disturbed in their slumber,
screamed around them. The oars were of little service,
save to steady the boat in the dreadful pitchings
and careerings to which it was every instant subjected.
One managed the oars, or sculls rather, while
the other steered and occasionally bailed. There
could be no transfer of labor, for it was certain death
to attempt a change of position. Although the
current set along the land, the wind and the heave
of the sea, drove them indirectly toward it. After
five hours incessant fatigue, cold, cramped and
wearied to exhaustion, they reached the near vicinity
of the shore, and running along it for about a mile, in
increased danger, for the boat was now nearly broadside
to the sea, they made the mouth of a small
harbor, into which, as their frames thrilled with gratitude,
they pulled with all their might. As the peace
and the joys of heaven are to the wrangling and contumelies
of this world, so was the placid stillness of
that sheltered nook to the fierce wind and troubled
sea without. The transition was as sudden as it was
delightful, and with uncovered heads and upturned
gaze, each paid his heartfelt tribute of thankfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On one side of the sequestered little bay, through
the dim and uncertain light, they discovered two or
three huts, embowered and almost concealed by
groves of the umbrageous and productive banana,
whose large pendent-leaves waving in the wind,
seemed at one time to beckon them on, and at another
to warn them from approaching. It was evidently
a fishing settlement, for there were some boats
hauled up on the shore, and a long seine was hung
upon a number of upright poles. Pulling toward
what seemed the usual landing, their light skiff grated
upon the pebbly beach, and they leaped, overjoyed,
upon the silent shore—silent and mute in all that
pertains to human action or the human voice, but
eloquent, most eloquent, in the outpourings of a rich
and teeming earth, and the gushing emotions of
thankfulness it awakened in the bosoms of those two
weary and persecuted men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the series of papers (and they will have the rare
merit of being short) which I am about to offer to the
reader, I shall not so far follow the ill fashion of the
day as to strive to be “original.” I do not mean by
this remark to signify that I shall not give my own
thoughts in my own way. But I shall not twist the
English language out of all shape and comeliness;
I shall not Germanize and Frenchize and Italianize;
I shall express my ideas in the simplest possible
words; I shall always choose the Saxon rather than
the Norman; I shall endeavor to write so that “he
who runs may read.” Were I a teacher of youth,
I should recommend as the best models of style
Swift and Southey, Addison, Steele, Channing, Sir
James Macintosh, Irving, not Carlyle, Gibbon, Johnson,
Emerson. I set plain Nature above gorgeous
Art. The epithet “natural” conveys to my mind
the highest praise of verse or prose. A style may
indeed be eminently artistic, but still appear to be
natural.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have said enough to show the manner in which
I shall try to convey my ideas. Fewer words will
set forth the character of my matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have no subject. I think, in my solitude, of
many things. As thoughts occur to me I put them
down. Though a Recluse, and having but little society
except that of woods and fields, rocks and
waters, I am fond of contemplating the events of the
hour. Many of my topics will therefore be of immediate
interest. They will at least have the charm
of variety, and my “mode of treatment,” to use an
expression of physicians, the merit of brevity.</p>

I salute you.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_4'>I.—THE CROTON CELEBRATION.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Of all public displays, that which affected me most
deeply was the celebration of the opening of the Croton
river into the great city of New York. A day
had been appointed by the powers in being. Arrangements
were made for a mighty civic procession. It
was a jubilee of Cold Water. The Temperance
Societies figured chiefly on the occasion. Those
trades which best flourish by the practice of temperance
were numerously represented, bearing before
them their symbols and instruments. I remember
a printing-press on a platform, borne triumphantly
along, working as it went, throwing off handbills, on
which odes were printed, to the eager and amused
crowd on both sides of the way. By the side of that
printing-press sat, in smiling dignity, Colonel Stone,
as everybody called him, then editor of the Commercial
Advertiser. Kind-hearted, conscientious, hospitable,
credulous, verbose gentleman! thou art sleeping
as silently as those aboriginal lords of the soil
whose lives thou commemoratedst!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have seen a great many multitudes, but never so
quiet, so orderly, so well-dressed, so happy a concourse
as that which filled the windows and balconies
and doorsteps, and absolutely covered the sidewalks,
on the morning of the Croton celebration.
Throngs of gayly clad women and children moved
merrily about; for there was not a solitary drunkard
that day in all the streets of the city to molest or
make them afraid. An individual under the influence
of any liquor more potent than that which was
gushing from a thousand fountains, would have been
an anomaly too hideous to be borne. Braver than
Julius Cæsar or Zachary Taylor must he have been
who dared to took upon wine red in the cup on such
a day as that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I well remember the reflections which passed
through my mind as I stood gazing on that happy and
soul-comforting scene. The treaty of peace, as it
might well have been called, establishing the North-Eastern
boundary of the United States, settling a
<span class='it'>questio vexata</span> of long continuance, which had again
and again threatened war, had just been concluded
between this country and Great Britain—thanks to
the pacific dispositions and noble talents of the negotiators.
Thinking of this, as I looked at the mighty
civic array, at the procession, which was like an
endless chain of human beings, the head of it, after
having traveled through six miles of streets, meeting
the tail of it, which had not yet drawn an inch of its
slow length along, below the Park—as I looked at
the smiling faces and the sporting fountains—I exclaimed
to myself, How glorious a scene is this!
How much worthier of a free people than the martial
triumphs of old! A great good has been done.
Energy and Skill have effected a stupendous work.
Thousands and thousands are met together on an appointed
day, to commemorate an achievement which
shall prove a blessing to many generations yet unborn.
Indeed, indeed this is more to be desired
than the most complete of victories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went on thus with my cogitations. Let me suppose
that these negotiations between two nations,
strong in men and the resources of warfare, negotiations
skillfully conducted to a most fortunate issue,
and the establishment of a peace in which all the
world is interested, had proved to be unsuccessful.
Suppose that war had been declared, that we had no
longer ago than yesterday received intelligence of a
conquest on the sea, that a fierce battle had been
fought, and that our ships had come into port laden
with spoils and crowded with prisoners. How different
to-day would have been our rejoicings! The
outward demonstrations might, in some respects,
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>
have been the same. The streets would have been
filled with multitudes of men; the bells of the churches
(oh sacrilege!) would have pealed long and loudly;
the flag of our country would have waved from many
a house-top and “liberty-pole”—yet, in the midst of
all this, there would have been distinguished the trophies
of wo and of disaster. The cannon, which had
dealed death to the brave, would have been borne
through the streets, and the banners of the conquered
trailed in the dust. Execrations would have mingled
with shouts, and frowns of hatred with smiles of joy.
Sorrow and anguish would have been comates with
exultation and delight, and the hilarity of all hearts
deeply subdued by the sad faces of many mourners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And how different would have been our inward
emotions! Instead of “calm thoughts regular as
infant’s breath,” we should have experienced a
tumultuous rapture, a demoniac triumph, an uneasy
and restless joy, a trembling pride, a satisfaction
with the present embittered by fears for the future.
Now we rejoice with cheerful consciences. No
“coming events cast their shadows before” to cloud
the horizon of hope. We look upon a cloudless firmament
above us and around us. We are indeed
proud of the task which has been accomplished; but
ours is a pride unmixed with any baser emotion—a
pride honorable to humanity. Ah, how much more
glorious is this than a victory! It is a sight to make
the old young—a sight worthy of perpetual commemoration.
It will be always recollected. We
shall tell it to our children’s children. From time to
time our authors shall write of it—so that it may
always live in the memory of the age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have modernized the orthography of the foregoing
quaint and beautiful stanzas, from the dress in
which they are clothed in the second part of the
Diary of Lady Willoughby, just published by John
Wiley, bookseller, in New York. They are happily
imitative of the style of the poets of olden time.
They remind one of George Herbert—that “sweet
singer in the Israel” of the English church, of Donne,
of Wotton, and of other lyrists, who chanted the
praises of our God. To my ear, much dearer are
such simple, tuneful verses than the grandiloquent
outpourings of the more modern muse. They come
home, as it were, to one’s child-like sympathies.
They awaken the thoughts of “youthly years;” they
freshen the withered feelings of the heart, as heaven’s
dew freshens the dried leaves in summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let me recommend this most tender, most soul-touching
of “late works”—these passages from the
Diary of Lady Willoughby. It is not a <span class='it'>real</span> “aunciente
booke,” but an imitation; yet, like certain
copies of a picture by an old master, it may boast
some touches better than the original. Chatterton’s
forgeries were not more perfect in their way, though
this be no forgery, but what it pretends to be—namely,
an invention. I feared, when I took up the second
part of this remarkable production, that it would deteriorate
in interest, that the hand of the <span class='it'>artist</span> would
become manifest. But it is not so. Here, throughout,
is the <span class='it'>ars celare artem</span> in perfection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How touching a lesson do the feigned sorrows
the Lady Willoughby present to her sex. What absence
of repining! What reliance on the justice
and mercy of God! What trust in the merits of her
Redeemer! Her faith is never shaken. Her soul is
never dismayed. With an expression holier than
Raphael has imparted to his pictures of the Madonna,
she looks upward and is comforted. Ever into the
troubled waters of her soul descends the angel of
peace. Perfect pattern is she for wives and mothers.
Excellent example of a Christian woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Are not some of the prophecies being fulfilled in
these latter days? Trace we not in the decay of old
empires the tempest of God’s wrath? Is not the arm
of the Lord stretched out over the people and over
the nations of the earth? Breaks he not thrones to
pieces as if they were potter’s vessels? Where are
the kings and princes who were born and chosen
to rule over men? “How are the mighty fallen!”
Even now, as by the mouth of his holy prophet,
Isaiah, may the Lord say, “Is not <span class='it'>this</span> the fast that I
have chosen. To loose the bands of wickedness, to
undo the heavy burdened, and to let the oppressed
go free, and that ye break every yoke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Truly has my mind, shut out as I am from commune
with the busy world—truly has my mind been
deeply, solemnly affected by the wondrous events
which are passing in those realms, the pages of
whose history are printed in blood. I see the hand
of God in all. I trace the fulfillment of prophecies
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>
contained in the Book of books. I am oppressed by
a sensation of awe as I read the words of inspiration
and discern their truth in these latter days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was not the heart of Louis Philippe before his
sudden and terrible overthrow as stout as the heart
of the King of Assyria? Did not he, too, say of his
monarchy, his rule and his riches—not only to himself,
but even to the stranger in his land—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the strength of my hand I have done it and
by my wisdom; for I am prudent; and I have removed
the bounds of the people, and have robbed
their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants
like a valiant man; and my hand hath found as a
nest the riches of the people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And was he not likewise cast down? Was not a
burning kindled under his glory like the burning of a
fire? “And behold at evening-tide, trouble, and
before the morning he <span class='it'>was</span> not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the portion of them that spoil us,” shouted
the people of France at the overthrow of the family
of Orleans. “This is the portion of them that spoil
us, and the lot of them that rob us.”</p>

<p class='line'>In the heart of Rome eternal, the Coliseum stands sublime,</p>
<p class='line'>Lofty in the midst of ruins, like a temple built to Time.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Vast, colossal, ’tis with piles of broken arches reared on high,</p>
<p class='line'>But the dome is gone, and nothing roofs it but the summer sky.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And the walls are rent, and gaping wide, and crumbling fast away,</p>
<p class='line'>And the columns waste, but moss and grasses cover their decay.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>When the sky of June was bluest, melting as the eye of love,</p>
<p class='line'>And the breezes from Campagnia bore the city’s hum above;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Poring o’er the rich and classic authors of the Age of Gold,</p>
<p class='line'>Virgil, Horace, Terence, Plautus, Livy and historians old,</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>I imagined Rome restored as in the glorious days of yore,</p>
<p class='line'>Peopled by the great and mighty, as it shall be nevermore.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>I beheld the Past before me, and the fallen circus rose,</p>
<p class='line'>And the leaning columns righted, and the ruins seemed to close;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Flags were streaming on the lofty walls, and standards of renown,</p>
<p class='line'>Plucked from out some hostile army, or some sacked and burning town;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Proud patricians filled the boxes, judges, senators, in white,</p>
<p class='line'>Consuls from remotest provinces, and hosts of ladies bright;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And the emperor sat among them, in his regal purple proud,</p>
<p class='line'>And below a countless sea of heads, the common plebeian crowd;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Wrestlers struggled in the ring, and athlete and equestrians bold,</p>
<p class='line'>And the steeds and dashing chariots raised a cloud of dusty gold;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Troops of sworded gladiators, Dacian captives, fought and bled,</p>
<p class='line'>And the lists were strewn with wretches lying on their bucklers dead;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And in the arena Christian saints and martyrs, old and gray,</p>
<p class='line'>Were trampled in the dust, and torn by savage beasts of prey.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Sick of this, I turned and looking out the arches in the street,</p>
<p class='line'>I beheld a mighty multitude, a crowd with hurrying feet;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Nobles with their flowing togas, simple artisans bedight</p>
<p class='line'>In their holyday attire and badges, maids with eyes of light,</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Waving hands to lovers distant, and the little children clung</p>
<p class='line'>To their mother’s gowns, and nurses held aloft their infants young,</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And afar and pouring through the city gates a long array,</p>
<p class='line'>And in front, in his triumphal car, the hero of the day;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And his coursers champed their frosted bits and pranced, but all in vain,</p>
<p class='line'>Braced he stood, with streaming robe, and checked them with a tightened rein;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And a mournful group of kingly captives, dusty, drooping low,</p>
<p class='line'>Followed, fettered to his chariot, gracing his triumphal show;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Augurs and soothsayers, flamen, tribunes, lictors bearing rods,</p>
<p class='line'>And gray-bearded priests, with olive boughs and statues of the gods,</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Shaking from their brazen censers clouds of incense to the skies,</p>
<p class='line'>Leading lowing steers, in wreaths and garlands decked, to sacrifice.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Sacred nymphs from temples near, in spotless white, and vestal throngs</p>
<p class='line'>Followed solemn, dancing mystic dances, singing choral songs.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Cohorts of the Roman soldiers conquering legions marched behind,</p>
<p class='line'>With their burnished armor shining and their banners on the wind;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And, with distance faint, the brattling drums, the trumpet’s mighty blast,</p>
<p class='line'>And the clarion rung and sounded like an echo from the Past.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>All at once the glorious vision melted, faded in the air,</p>
<p class='line'>Like a desert exhalation, leaving all its ruin bare.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>And, in place of glory and the beauty of the olden day,</p>
<p class='line'>I beheld the Queen of Cities wasted, fallen in decay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sweet Sister of Charity, a faithful, never-wearying
missionary, is the beautiful Sunlight, daughter of
the proud monarch who reigns supremely over the
broad dominions of the “upper blue!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six long, tedious months in her father’s gorgeous
palace, had the lovely maiden been constrained to
mingle in the festal scenes which enlivened the
monarch’s dwelling during that dreary time when
the poor earth lay helplessly beneath the iron hand
of winter. How often from the palace-windows
had she looked with eyes dimmed with tears, and
most melancholy glances on the world that was subject
during all those months to a <span class='it'>natural</span> kind of
heathenish slavery! Despoiled of their rich garments
the old princes of the forests stretched forth their
naked arms toward her in supplication of her presence
and charitable aid. A voice, to no ear audible
save her own, crept up from beneath the winding-sheets
which envelopes streamlet and river; and a
wail that broke forth from the poor in their agony
and want, reached her gentle heart, and her tears fell
afresh. And even the children of gayety and fashion
felt an irresistable yearning in their hearts to listen
once more to her soft and gentle teachings!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But “’tis always the darkest the hour before day;”
and while Sunlight was half-despairingly revolving
in her mind all possible means by which she might
again, without the utmost danger of sudden death,
be enabled freely to wander over earth to beautify
and bless it, the discerning old king, her father, saw
how pale her cheek was growing, and how dimness
was creeping over her bright eyes. He knew she
wearied of, and longed heartily to escape from the
heartless pomp and magnificence which surrounded
her; so he resolved to carry into immediate execution
a plan he had long been contemplating. He
would make a sudden and strong attack on his old
foe who was lording it so magnificently over earth!
He would teach the rough, boorish chieftain, in a
way he could not mistake, that there were other and
mightier powers in existence than his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he fought long and valiantly, and won the
victory—a glorious one it was, too. In a few days
many sharp, fierce conflicts had taken place, the
glittering crown of winter was broken, his staff of
office taken from him, and the disagreeable old gray-beard
was forced to skulk away in silence and shame
and confusion of face, to his bleak and fitting home
at the North Pole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(Would he were wise enough not to attempt again
another short-lived triumph! But he is so Napoleon-ish
in his nature, we may well have our fears
on this point.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the king had returned to his palace the night
of the last decisive victory—after he had thrown
aside his golden armor, though weary from the conflict,
he paused not a moment to rest till he had summoned
his young daughter to his presence, and thus
made known to her his will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow, my child, put on thy most beautiful
and radiant garments, and let the bright smile come
back once more to thy face, for I have work for thee
to do. I have subdued the army of King Winter,
and now it shall be thine to make joy in the place
where he has sown desolation. It is thine, to restore
order and comfort and happiness and beauty in
the dwelling place where he reigned in such a rude,
uncivilized, mobocrastic manner. Ah! that light in
thine eye tells me it is no ungrateful task I set for thee!
it is very plain now, the cause of all thy sighing and
tears for so long back; the old bloom will revisit thy
cheek again I see. But remember, thy mission is
one all-important. Do all things well, and nothing
hastily—and now to rest! This shall be no gala-night,
thou needest all thy strength for thy work; so haste to
thy couch, and be stirring early in the morn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the maiden was thus assured of the fulfillment
of her greatest hope, she bended down at the
king’s feet and said, joyfully, “Oh, my father, I bless
thee for thy goodness. The dear earth, she shall
swiftly know thy mercy, and array herself in glorious
garments in which to honor her deliverer! To-morrow,
to-morrow shall see that if thou, my father,
art strong to make free, thy daughter is loving, and
patient, and full of good-will to help and adorn the
miserable captives thou hast delivered from bondage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And early the next morning the lovely princess
went forth alone, rejecting all offers of a body-guard,
a most devout and devoted missionary, whose end
and aim was to make glad the waste-places, and to
cause the wilderness to blossom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were as yet, here and there, stubborn patches
of snow on the ground, and a vindictive, sharp-voiced
wind, a wounded straggler belonging to the
white king’s retreating army, and his chief object
seemed to be to exhaust the patience of all who were
within hearing wherever he moved, by his rude insulting
speeches. But totally unmindful of him,
and maintaining a most dignified silence, Sunlight
passed by him, well knowing that he too would
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>
speedily be compelled to follow whither his master
had gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes dark, threatening clouds would flit before
her eyes, for a moment totally obstructing her vision,
but a brave heart was that maiden’s, and when these
petty annoyances were passed, she continued on her
way patiently and hopefully as before. An apparently
hopeless and endless task was that Sunlight had undertaken.
She must, as it were, perform the part of
resurrectionist. She must breathe life into a breathless
body, and call the seemingly dead forth from
their graves. The labor seemed too vast for her
gentle hand, it appeared almost impossible that she
should accomplish it. She was alone, too, in a
strange, unpleasant kind of silence. There was not
the voice of even a bird to cheer her on, and stiff and
mute the brooklets lay in their coffins of ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she is very far from despairing. And her strength
is, indeed, perfectly wonderful. Stealing with quiet
steps along the banks of the little streams, she speaks
to them some words apparently powerful as the
“open sesame,” for the waters begin to open their
eyes, faintly the pulse begins to throb, and the heart
to beat, and ere long they have wholly thrown off
that cold shroud which enveloped them, while it in
turn becomes part and parcel of their own rejoicing
life. Then they set forth rejoicing in their strength,
and glorying in their newly-gained liberty, careering
through the just awakening fields, and astonishing
them by the beautiful soft songs of thanksgiving they
unremittingly sing. The princess is not alone then—one
class of prisoners she has released, and their glad
voices cheer and encourage her in her work of love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day after day she returns unweariedly to the great
field of her pleasant labor, and day by day perfects
the evidence of her progress. A most efficient co-worker
whom she arouses and entices to join her in
her work, is the gentle spirit of the summer wind.
Encouraged and excited by her smile, he takes the
oath of fealty, and heartily strives to aid his mistress.
From the brow of earth he wipes away the tears the
stars have wept, and multitudinous are his kind unceasing
offices, for she has promised him a dominion
which shall spread over many <a id='rejuv'></a>rejuvenated forests,
and freshly garmented fields!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the old woods she lays her hand upon the
myriad branches, and on the softening ground beneath
which lie the buried roots. From every bough
she calleth forth the tender buds, and ere long she
spreads with kindly hands a rich, green mantle over
all the forests. And in those “leafy-pavilions,” the
returning birds she has summoned from the south,
build their nests, and sing merrily through the long,
happy days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quickened into life by her presence and word, over
all the barren fields the soft and tender grass springs
up; the moss becomes aspiring, too, even the humble
moss, and disowning its gray garments, it dons the
more beautiful and universal green livery. A thousand
thousand insects spring into sudden existence—the
voice of the croaking frog is once more found in
tune. Violets bud and blossom, the air grows increasingly
more mild; even the wind learns a sweeter
song; the heavens finding it impossible to resist the
general rejoicing which follows the most successful
labor of the missionary, put on a brighter and a more
resplendant garment, and the dear Sunlight is filled
with unfeigned rejoicing when she sees how speedily
the regenerating influences of her glance are recognized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is spring-time then!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Weeks pass on, but Sunlight does not tarry in her
work; the grand commencement she has made, but
the work of perfecting is yet to be done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gradually she spreads a richer green over all the
meadows; all along the banks of streams and lakes
the grass grows long and soft—the leaves hang heavier
and fuller on the forest boughs—a softer voice whispers
through the day-time and the night—flowers
blossom more richly and abundantly, and the air is
filled with their fragrance. Sunlight has spread the
perfection of beauty over earth, and filled with unutterable
affection for the world she has beautified,
more warm and tender grow her embracings—and
in return the voices of all the earth go up in a fervent
declaration of love and gratitude to the fair
missionary who has so generously, so gloriously labored
for them. The good, beautiful Sunlight! no
wonder all creation loves her, and blesses her; no
wonder that innumerable objects, on all other subjects
dull and voiceless, discover a way in which to
sing her praises!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It were idle to attempt a detail of all the <span class='it'>homes and
hearts</span> that even in one day she blesses and enlivens
by her presence; but let us for a few moments follow
her in her wanderings, perhaps thereby we may gain
a proper appreciation of the labors of this good angel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is morning, and she has just alighted on the
earth; and see now where her light feet are first
directed. On yonder hill there stands a lofty building—secure
as a fortress, made of stone, and brick, and
iron. It is a gloomy, comfortless looking place; the
windows, though it is a warm summer morning, are
fast closed, and bars of iron stretch over them! It is
a prison-house; but, though its inmates are guilty
criminals, the pure and high-born Sunlight does not
disdain to visit them. She is looking through all those
grated windows fronting us—will you also look in?</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a criminal condemned to death—a hardened
villain, whose unbridled passions have worked
his ruin. He is yet far from old, not a gray hair is
there in all that thick black mass which crowns his
head! From his youth up his life has been a life of
sin, and little remorse. Heaven has at last overtaken
him, and he will soon fearfully expiate, in
part, his guilt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yesterday, justice delivered to him the sentence;
he listened to it as though he heard it in a trance, and
ever since they brought him from the presence of
the excited court, he has sat on that hard pallet, immoveable
as now. His food is untouched—he has
no time to feel the wants of nature; his arms are
closely, convulsively folded upon his breast; the
black, large eyes, have a fixed and stony glare, in
which it would seem few tears had ever gathered;
firmly compressed are the pale lips; no prayer or
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>
sigh, or moan shall issue from them! He knows
there is no way of escape for him—that on such a
day, at such an hour, he will perish by the executioner’s
hand; and that dreadful fact it is which is
constantly staring in his face, and writing such a record
of shame and terror in his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He feels no penitence—nothing but anger, that he
has stupidly suffered himself to be overtaken by the
hand of the law—that his crimes have been detected.
It is not the fear of God that is before his eyes; it is
not dread of the hereafter which so overpowers him,
but hatred of his fellow men, and a desire to wreak
his vengeance on them who have brought to light
his guilt!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through all the long, dark hours he has rested on
his hard bed, listening to the “voices of the night,”
and not one softening thought has entered his heart,
not one repentant sigh has he breathed. It seemed
then as though nothing could arouse him as he so
coldly beheld the reality, death staring him in the
face. But now see, there is a faint glow on the
narrow window-pane, and it grows brighter and
brighter. Creeping slowly along the wall it reaches
him at last—it falls upon his breast—it glances over
his hard face, where sin has written her signature
with a pen, as of iron—it looks into his stern eyes—that
light arouses him, and while he returns the
piercing gaze of the sunbeam, human feelings are
aroused in his breast once more. He rises from the
place where in his rage he had flung himself—he
gazes round the contracted, miserable cell in which
he is secured! Alas! and he has fallen so far that
humanity acknowledges the justice of immuring him
in a prison! and as he gazes on the gentle spirit
whose presence fills his cell with light, the recollections
of his far-off, innocent childhood—of his early
home, from whence not a great many years ago he
went with the blessing of his old mother sounding in
his ears, steals over him—his heart is softening—his
lips tremble—the stolid, hardened look has passed
from his countenance—he is human again—he weeps!
Blessed Sunlight! Fairest and holiest of the missionaries,
who come from the halls of heaven to purify
the earth, she has subdued him! Oh, we will hope
that now, since the heart of stone has been changed
to one of flesh, the good, redeeming work may not
stop there; we will hope that when he is standing in
his last hour upon the scaffold, when she comes to
him again, it may be with a faith-supported heart
that he will behold in her brightness a token of the
blissful rest which awaits his repentant, pardoned
spirit!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Close adjoining this cell there is another which
likewise has its guilty inmate—a miserable, abandoned
woman. She is sleeping. For her violation
of the laws both of God and man she is now imprisoned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She is sleeping, but hers is a troubled slumber,
for conscience is at work night and day in the mind
of that woman, accusing and condemning—yet she
sleeps. She is dreaming of the husband of her early
years—of the child in whom, when she was young
and innocent, and of contented mind, her hope and
joy centered; she is dreaming of her maiden home—of
her bridal morning. The voices of her former,
youthful friends are ringing in her ears; the innocent
thoughts and hopes of girlhood fill her heart again.
She wakens weeping—for in imagination she is
standing once more beside the death-bed of her
mother, listening to the words of warning and counsel
that mother forces herself to speak when she beholds
with all a parent’s agony that the girl of her hopes
is treading in the wild paths of shame and sin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She wakens in tears, with a strange feeling of
contrition that she has seldom or never felt before
agitating her bosom, to see the Sunlight looking
down with pitying glance upon her—to see the good
spirit whose mission it is to make glad and bright the
earth, deigning to creep through those prison-bars to
speak a word of counsel and hope to her. Thoughts
of her husband, on whose honest name she has cast
such dishonor, and of her deserted, innocent child,
come to her full of most sorrowful reproach. A longing
for the restoration of her lost virtue—a conviction
of the peacefulness and happiness and exceeding
reward attending goodness, ever make her unsealed
tears flow more freely. Beside that narrow bed, on
the stone floor of her cell, she kneels down in her
sorrow and contrition, and on her knees she breathes
forth such a prayer as never before went from her
heart. And the dear Sunlight is witness of that
prayer! She looks upon the kneeling penitent with
joy—and from that now hallowed place she does not
steal forth hastily, leaving the cell dreary and comfortless
as before; she is there when the woman rises
from her supplication, as though to assure of the
smile of Heavenly forgiveness, which may yet await
her. She remains to give encouragement to the hope
that the corroding stains now resting on her soul
may be ere long effectually wiped away—that reconcilement
and love and peace, are yet for her on
earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near this woman’s cell there is another where a
youth, unjustly accused, singularly blameless and innocent
in his life, is singing a morning hymn of
praise and adoration. Hemmed in as he is by the
prison-wall, deprived of that freedom which is the
good man’s <span class='it'>best</span> possession, confined with guilty men,
and bearing himself the heavy imputation of crime,
yet is he supported by the comforting knowledge of
his innocence, and by the assurance that the eye
which is strong to pierce the secrets of the heart,
knows his innocence. The dreariness of his confinement
does not fill his soul with terror; his faith
is strong in the power and goodness of his Maker, and
so it is with patience he performs the labor apportioned
him, looking confidently for the hour of his
release, and the honorable conviction of his uprightness
in the minds of all honest men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when the kindly Sunlight appears before <span class='it'>him</span>,
her presence but serves to foster these hopes. It is
a sweet message of patience and faith she whispers
to him, and after she has departed, through all the
long day its remembrance strengthens and cheers
him. Blessed be the good spirit who remembers to
visit these sad, afflicted, guilty ones in the hour when
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>
they are well-nigh forgotten of all the world, and by
their own kin!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond the prison, on the same range of elevated
grounds, just without the city, there is a cemetery—a
quiet place where the dead sleep in peace. And
thither Sunlight bends her golden, sandaled feet.
How brightly her shadow lies on the white monuments,
and on the grass and flowers. How quiet
and holy is this place, there is no sound of the tread
of living feet to disturb the rest of the slumberers;
no human form at this early hour is treading in this
solitary place to muse on the “vanity of all earthly
things,” or to weep over the departed! Oh, yes!
there, by that newly-made grave, where the sod has
been placed so recently, there, where the print of the
feet of the funeral-train is yet fresh on the loosened
ground, there stands a child with flowers in her
hand; she has come to lay them on the grave of her
mother! The Sunlight knew that she would meet
her there, for every morning since the day the funeral-train
paused there, and laid the loving mother in the
dark, cold, “narrow house,” the little girl has visited
that grave, bringing with her to beautify it, and make
it seem a rest more sweet and cheerful, the flowers
from her little garden, which early in the spring her
mother planted there. When the child goes back to
the city, the vast crowds of life will have awakened,
and the rush, and jar, and strife, will have begun;
happy were it for all those multitudes, if a voice,
gentle and holy in its teaching as has spoken to that
young girl, whispered also to them, ere they mingled
in the whirlpools of business and pleasure!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then amid the dwellings of the city Sunlight
wanders next. And by no means is she sure to honor
first with her presence the mansions of the rich; for
at such an early hour she would hardly receive a
welcome there; perhaps, however, this is not the
sole reason why the very first place which she
chooses to enter is the cot of the humble laborer.
Gently does she lay her fair hand on his rude,
weather-worn frame, and tenderly she kisses his
hard-browned face, as a loving mother embraces
her infant. And if the man does not at once awaken
at the call of her royal highness, she does not go
away and leave him in <span class='it'>humanly</span> anger, but yet
more lovingly does she caress him, thinking meanwhile
to herself, “poor man, he was worn out by
his hard work yesterday.” And so at last by her
patient gentleness she succeeds in awakening him—and
when he rubs his eyes, and sees her waiting for
him there, with her soft hand, on which the regal
ring is glistening, resting so lovingly upon him, how
he reproaches himself that he has dared to sleep
while she was honoring his poor roof by her presence!
and how fervent is the blessing with which
his heart blesses her, as he hastens away to his labor
with a light heart and renewed courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later in the day, peeping into the small windows
of the unpretending school-room, she beckons to the
little children to come out and ramble with her among
the fields, to hunt for the ripe strawberries in the
grass, and to gather the violets, and lilies, and <a id='wild'></a>wild-geranium
flowers which grow in the shady woods.
A beautiful song she sings to the merry youngsters—a
song whose burden has more of wisdom in it than
many gather from their books in the coarse of years—a
lesson of reverence of freedom, and of innocent
love for nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sunlight is not content with merely resting like
a <span class='it'>visible blessing</span> on the head of the gentle girl
whose breast is throbbing with a “love for all things
pure and holy,” she steals into her guileless heart,
and makes <span class='it'>that</span> glorious by her smiling there; and
the little one laughs while she lingers, because she
fancies that all the future to which she looks forward,
will prove as bright and joyous as the unclouded
present. And as for the king’s daughter,
she knows when she hears that joyous ringing laugh
which always welcomes her presence, that it is
indeed more blessed to give than to receive!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bright-eyed maiden <span class='it'>loves</span> children, with all
the earnestness of her soft, true heart, and how
earnestly they return her love, let every man and
woman and child answer! She is, indeed, like a
kind and gentle elder friend to them—like a friend
whose heart has not grown cold or hard from much
mingling with the world, who knows how to sympathize
with them in their simple joys, who listens to
their merry voices with a tender interest, which
time has not been enabled to make cold or false.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well may the children love her, whose smile is
the grand main-spring of their joy—the constant inspirer
of their never-ceasing hope!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Look for a moment into this alms-house. Poor
people, the wretchedly poor, who were rendered at
last, by long destitution utterly unable to work with
the rude elements of life, which lay like broken useless
tools around them, are gathered here for rest, that
they may gain strength for a renewal of their conflict!
For a few weeks, and perhaps a longer time,
they may dwell in this comfortable shelter, and partake
of food, <span class='it'>not</span> gathered from the refuse of rich
men’s tables—they may partially rest from their hard,
unsatisfactory, unproductive labor. Let us hope
that Sunlight may not speak vainly to them now, as
every day she livens up their new home, let us hope
they may understand the cheering messages she
brings to them, and as they learn more of the goodness
and justice of their Creator <span class='it'>than they have ever
yet had time</span> to learn, perhaps with more of hope and
resignation they will endure their burden. It were
well to go through necessity to a poor-house, even
if we can find no other school in which to learn the
grand lesson of endurance and continuance in well-doing;
there, perhaps, it would not be impossible to
understand the messages dear Sunlight delivers every
day to our unappreciating, slow-hearing minds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notwithstanding all our boasted democracy, there
is scarcely a being on the face of the earth who embraces
with quite such heartiness its principles, and
so understands its precepts as—Sunlight. How graciously
her hand is laid on the matted locks of those
children of want; how lovingly and earnestly is her
kiss imprinted on their toil-grimmed faces—how
radiantly her smile envelops them. Ah! well-a-day!
would there were in human hearts as much of genuine
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>
love! No sham-tenderness, nor aristocratic, cold-blooded,
<span class='it'>repelling</span> fondness, is there in her embracing,
stronger than a <span class='it'>human</span> heart’s beating is that
which proclaims the life that is in <span class='it'>her</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>See now in this other place, where helpless orphans
are collected and cared for, children whose parents
have died and left them helpless and dependent on
the bounty of the world; Sunlight has not forgotten
them either. Kindly hands and charitable hearts
have gathered these little ones from hovels of sin,
and sorrow, and shame, and nurtured by the good
and the wise, in early manhood and womanhood they
will be prepared to struggle for themselves, and to
bear their own life-burden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day after day the affectionate Sunlight visits these
assembled little ones, and adds her cheerful blessing
to that which God has already pronounced on them,
whose love has prompted them out of their abundance
to support and comfort the destitute and friendless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there is another place teeming with human
life, where this good friend of earth and her children
comes daily, but where there are very few who may
welcome her smiling approach, but few to know
certainly of her departure when she is gone. This
is the home for the blind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How many are the fair young faces and graceful,
gentle forms and innocent hearts, how frequent are
the kindly words in that place; and yet, alas! how
small the power to see and know the beauty of the
world; how few the eyes to behold the approaching
of the fair <a id='dau'></a>daughter of the sun! The blind live there,
but Sunlight does not shun them! When she enters
their dwelling-place unsummoned, and only attended
by that glory with which God has adorned her, they
may, it is a fact they often do, know that something
blessed and heavenly is nigh, because they feel it in
their enlivening senses, in the warmth of her caressing.
But they may not touch her hand; and when
they speak to her she does not answer them; and
so they know she is not a mortal, but a spirit who
may not speak with an audible voice to them—a
spirit though which loves and blesses them!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us follow on further in her path, where polished
doors are fastened against the intruding world. It is
a home of fashion, but from the parlor windows no
token of life are seen. The blinds are closed—the
dwelling looks uninhabited. But there <span class='it'>is</span> life within,
ay, and death, too! Around the silver door-knob, and
circling the door-bell handle, where the hands of the
wealthy and gay have so often rested, (but very rarely
those of the poor and needy,) there is wound a scarf
of crape, and mournfully the death-token flutters in
the morning air. For two days scarcely a form has
entered those doors; the sufferers within, however
much they may have rejoiced in display in former
days, have no wish that there may be spectators to
their sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet there is one—a not often heeded guest, though
a seldom failing one—who comes to them now they
cannot shut her out; she longs to utter some soothing
and consoling word. She penetrates to the very
scene of their grief. She looks into the silent chamber
where the father and mother are weeping over their
only child—the child of whom they had made an
idol, whom God, who hath said “thou shalt have <span class='it'>no</span>
gods but me,” hath taken away from them. They
have with their own hands laid their child in her coffin,
ere long they will see her borne away from them
forever; so it is with unutterable sorrow they stand
beside that little one and gaze on her pale face. The
blinds are closed, and the curtains partly drawn, but
through an open shutter the Sunlight enters the
darkened room, and drawing near to the bereaved
parents, she lays her hand, oh, so gently on the forehead
of the child!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clustering curls which fall upon that brow
seem almost illuminate beneath the pressure of that
hand—and the mother’s tears fall faster as she looks
on the beautiful little one that will be so soon hidden
away from the pleasant day-light and the hopes of
life. But as the father looks, his sorrow is abated,
his voice is lifted up, there is hope in its tone, he
says, “Mary, let us weep no longer over our child,
her spirit has already won a brighter crown than that
the sunlight lays upon her head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the mother’s grief becomes less wild, and
humble is the voice with which she makes answer,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God help us, it was his to take away who gave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now with more of submission under their
affliction, with much of hope that cheered even in
the midst of their bereavement, they will see their
child laid in the funeral-vault to meet their eyes no
more until the resurrection morning—and with
chastened hearts, and more thoughtfully they will
tread the path set before them, feeling convinced
and thankful that sorrow has taught them a lesson of
wisdom they never could have learned in a life like
that they had lived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the opened Gothic windows of the old
church she is speeding, for what? To make beautiful
by her presence the temple of the Lord. See! before
the altar there is gathered a little group, and a
maiden and a youth are answering the binding, “I
will,” to a question than which none more fraught
with deep and solemn meaning was ever propounded
to mortal man and woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bridegroom has placed upon his companion’s
finger the uniting ring—she is his wife. You see she
has arrayed herself gayly; it is the great festival of
her life—may it not prove the adornment has been
for the ceremony of the sacrifice of all the dearest and
best hopes of her trusting young heart! Around these
happy ones are gathered their most familiar, dearest
friends; before them the “solemn priest,” and, hark!
with mingled words of warning, and of counsel, and
of blessing, he pronounces them now man and wife.
And upon the newly-wedded ones is resting the congratulatory
smile of Sunlight! She bids them joy in
their love, and gives the bridegroom the comforting
assurance that his will not prove a cross and turbulent
bride, for his wedding-day is calm and bright,
and over all the sky there is not one speck of cloud!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But why does the Sunlight linger when the bridal
party has gone forth? She is about the altar and
chancel, as though there were others yet who would
need her presence and her blessing there.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>
Ah! there are steps—another group is approaching
the awaiting “holy man of God.” A woman comes,
bearing in her arms a child for baptism. The font
containing the regenerating waters is there in readiness.
Troops of invisible angels are nigh to listen
to and make record of the solemn vows now to be
made, and the spirit of the living God is there also,
a witness, merciful in his omnipotence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are but few who accompany the woman—she
comes in no pomp and state to dedicate her child
to God in baptism; neither is the offering she brings
adorned with the pride of wealth. The mother is
poor—the child an heir of poverty. But will He
therefore spurn the gift? “He that cometh to me I
will in no wise cast out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father of the child, the husband of the mother
is dead—and her widow’s weeds but “faintly tell
the sorrow of her heart.” Therefore it is with so
much the more trustful confidence she has come with
her child to the altar, she will give him into the
watchful care of the Almighty Father of the fatherless!
With what a solemn earnest voice she takes upon
herself, for the child, the vow of renouncement of
the world and its sinful desires; and when the sign of
the cross is laid upon the brow of her infant, and the
holy waters which typify its regeneration are poured
upon his head, it is with heartfelt gratitude she lifts
her heart to heaven, with heartfelt confidence she
implores his watchful love and care. And all the
while on the uncovered head of the child the glance
of the sunlight has rested, as if in token of the acceptance
of the offering the mother has made, in
token that the blessing and mercy of God would be
upon that child for whom a holy vow was registered
in heaven, which he must one day redeem, or else
pay the fearful penalty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the mother with her child and friends
have left the church, and a sacred quiet reigns there
once more; yet the priest lingers by the altar, still
arrayed in his robes of office, and Sunlight also remains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, hark! once more the “deep-toned bell” is
ringing now—tolling mournfully—no wedding-peal
of joy is that, from out the heart of the strong iron is
rung the stern tale that another mortal hath put on
immortality! Now they come, a long and silent
train, and foremost move the bearers treading
heavily; “it is a man they bear”—an aged man, the
measure of whose cup of life was well filled, reaching
even the brim; and following after them are the
children, and grandchildren, and great-grandchildren
of the deceased, and the procession is closed by his
many friends and neighbors. Of all that lengthened
train there is not one who set out on the path of life
with the dead man. One by one his early companions
passed away, there are none who retain a
recollection of that aged face when it was smooth,
and of those locks now so very white and thin, as
they were in earlier years; not one who shared the
hopes of his childhood with him—few who mingled
with him in the scenes remembered now as of the
old, old time. Yet the mourners weep, and the bells
toll mournfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man has finished his course with honor
and with joy. Reverenced and loved, he has gone
down to the grave—no, I must not say that, he has
gone upward <span class='it'>to rest on the bosom of his Father</span>! In
boyhood he was wild, and fearless, and reckless—his
manhood, generous and upright, nobly redeemed
his early days—and happy, and peaceful, and honorable,
was his “green old age.” And now he has
“gone to his reward”—his race well run, his labor
all fulfilled, it seems strange that any should weep.
They have laid back the coffin-lid that the assembled
people may once more look on their venerated
friend. Oh, how peacefully he sleeps, and lovingly,
as on the unconscious infant, the Sunlight, that messenger
of consolation, looks upon the calm, cold face,
and the mourner’s grief is stayed as they behold the
brightness which once more illuminates those lifeless
features.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the infant, dedicated to God in the days when
he lies helplessly at the portal of life, on the maiden
and the youth, entering on a state of existence, either
supremely blessed or supremely cursed in its <span class='it'>eventuation</span>,
and on the dead old man, whose race so
long, and of mingled pleasure and hardship, is over
at last; on these the faithful Sunlight has pronounced
her blessing within the walls of the old church. But
now all the human beings have gone away, the
minister with the funeral train to the burial, and the
sexton has fastened the church-doors and gone too;
but still the Sunlight remains, and it seems as though
she were kneeling before the altar now, craving God’s
blessing on all those who have this day stood within
His courts, and before His altar, brought there by joy
or sorrow to rejoice or to weep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not, however, within the sanctity of walls alone
does the Sunlight make herself visible. Through byways,
and in the open street, where the stream of
life goes rushing on violently, does she tread, brightening
up by her presence dark and dismal corners,
and enlivening the gloomiest and dreariest places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the intervening places between the high brick
dwellings and stores she stations herself; there, like
a priestess, she stands to pronounce a benediction
on all who pass by her. On the blind old beggar, led
by a little child, who pause a moment to rest in the
sunshiny place, for they have walked on wearily
amid a heartless crowd, that had but little feeling for
the poverty-stricken old man, whom Heaven deprived
of sight; and on the gaudily decked form of
the shameless woman, as a reproach and condemnation;
on the proud, hard man, whose haughty head
and iron heart care little for the Sunlight or for Sorrow,
whose honorable name has safely borne him
through the committal of sins and crimes, which,
had he been poor and friendless, would have long
ago secured for him a safe place among convicts and
outlaws! Little recks <span class='it'>he</span> of Sunlight. A blessing
so freely bestowed on all, as is her smile, is not what
he covets; so through shade and light he hastens, and
soon enough he will arrive at the bourne. What
bourne?</p>

<p class='pindent'>There go by the wandering minstrels, men from
Scotland with their bagpipes—Italians with hurdy-gurdy—girls
with tamborines, and boys with violins
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>
and banjoes—there are professors of almost all kinds
of instrumental music, and vocal too, a great many
of them there are, but sure, almost all of them, of
winning coppers from some who would bribe them
into a state of quietude, and from other some, harmony-loving
souls, who delight in the dulcet sounds
such minstrels ever awaken and give utterance to!
And Sunlight blesses <span class='it'>them</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And here comes an humble, tired-looking woman—a
school teacher she is, whose days are one continued
round of wearying, and most monotonous
action. You would scarcely err in your first guess
as to her vocation—it speaks forth in her “dress a
little faded,” but so very neat, but more loudly still
in that penetrating glance of her eye, and in the patient
expression of her features. Though she is evidently
hurried, for she has been proceeding at a most
rapid pace along the streets, you could tell she has
some appreciation of the glory of Sunlight, for how
she lingers whenever she comes near the places enlivened
by her presence! Her feet, too, press less
heavily the pavement, perhaps she feels as though
she were treading on sacred ground!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, there comes another, a little, frail, youthful
creature, with bright, black eyes, (which have obviously
a quick recognization power for “every
thing pretty,”) a person of quick and nervous movement,
a seamstress. She has not time often to pause
and take note of the beautiful. Her weeks have in
their long train of hours only twelve of daylight she
may call her own! She, too, steps slowly, almost
reverently, over the flags where the princess is stationed,
and with an irresistible sigh thinks of earlier
and happier days, when a merry country child she
rejoiced in her delightful freedom, though clad she
was then in most unfashionable garments, and almost
she regretted the day that sent her into the great,
selfish city to fashion dresses for the rich and gay.
Poor girl! before she has half passed over the shady
place which succeeds the glimpse of Sunlight, she
has forgotten the hope which for a moment found
refuge in her breast, wild as it was, that one day she
might indeed go into the country again, and find there
a welcome and a home; for must not Miss Seraphina’s
and Miss Victoria’s dresses be finished that very
night in time for the grand party; and the flounces
are not nearly trimmed, and numberless are the
“finishing touches” yet to be executed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas! before night comes again, when she will go
alone, and in the darkness, through the noisy street,
in her weariness and stupidity, (for continued labor,
you know very well, reader, will make the brightest
mind stupid and weak,) she will hurry to her bed,
forgetful of her bright dream of the morning, unmindful
of her prayers, in the haste to close her
weak and tired eyes. But in the morning, perhaps,
the Sunlight will give to the overworked girl another
gleam of hope, another blessing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now goes by an interesting, white-gloved
youth, fresh from “the bandbox,” as you perceive.
Let him pass on; for there is but little chance that
Sunlight will be recognized by <span class='it'>him</span>, and so <span class='it'>we</span> will
not waste our comments, for could he even see
where lies the brightness, I cannot say but the inevitable
eye-glass might be raised, and such a glance of
idiocy and impudence be directed toward the gentle
daughter of the mighty king, as would warrant her
in annihilating him at once with a powerful <span class='it'>sunstroke</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here comes another, a benevolent, but solemn-featured,
portly gentleman, who seems in musing
mood, for he goes slowly along with head bent down.
He is a judge, proceeding toward the scene of his
trying duties, feeling the responsibility which rests
upon him, and nerving himself to meet the solemn
and affecting scenes and circumstances which may
await him. Oh may it be that as he passes by those
small illuminated places, that a stronger voice than
he has ever heard before may find utterance in his
heart, charging him to remember that the highest
attributes of the Heavenly Judge are mercy and
love, and that only as he employs them in his decisions,
can he justly imitate his Divine prototype!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now there is another going by, whose disappointment
is legibly written on his face. Either of
two doleful things has happened to him. His prayers
have been unheard by his “lady-love,” and she
looks coldly upon him, or—scarcely less to be dreaded
climax—his first attempt at literature has met with
unqualified failure. Let him but bear in mind that
“faint heart never won fair lady,” or honor in the
“literary world;” let him take one intelligent look
at the sweet Sunlight, as so patiently she stands there
before him, and small will be the danger of his ultimate
defeat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But—but how fast the crowd increases—it is growing
late, and between the increasing crowd of fashionables,
and of people of all sorts and conditions, we
are really in danger of being soon unable to distinguish
who of all the host stop for the blessing of Sunlight,
and who unmindful pass by her. And indeed
it were an endless task to impose on one’s self the
attempt to speak, or even to think, of the myriads
who in their hours of sorrow, despondency, tribulation
or joy, have had occasion to be thankful for the
cheerful smile of glorious Sunlight!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her mission—ay, never was there one so blest—and
never was there so faithful a missionary! She
comes with a message of love for the whole world!
How perfectly she has learned that lesson taught her
by our own, as well as her Almighty Father! How
nobly has she obeyed his sublime precepts, how truly
is she the joy-diffuser of the human race!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now what remaineth to be said? But one
thing only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a necessarily more contracted sphere of action
may there not from <span class='it'>our</span> faces, and <span class='it'>our</span> hearts, go
forth a beam of light that shall be <a id='power'></a>powerful to cheer
up a desponding spirit, or to encourage a drooping
heart, or to give comfort to a sorrowing soul, or to
increase the faith and courage of a lonely life?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cannot the sunshine of a human face, in the dark
forest of a sad heart, have power to make the old
trees bud, and the birds to sing, and the violets to
spring up and bloom, and the ice-bound streamlets to
go free? From many a love-lit eye, from many a

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_7'>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“You look sad to-night, Alice,” was the remark
of Mr. Colman as his young wife entered the sitting-room,
and took a seat beside him with a countenance
expressive of unusual dejection; “and where is
Maggie this evening that you have been obliged to
take upon yourself the duty of nursery-maid to our
little ones?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maggie has gone upon an errand of mercy—to
watch over a sick and suffering fellow creature,” replied
Mrs. Colman. “It is a long story,” she added,
in answer to the look of inquiry which her husband
cast upon her, “but I will endeavor to relate it if you
will listen to it patiently. This morning, Harry, after
you had left home, I resolved to set forth in search
of a seamstress who was making some dresses for
our little girl. She had failed to bring them home at
the time appointed, and as I had never employed her
before, and knew nothing of her character, I felt
rather anxious concerning the safety of the materials
I had given her to work upon, and determined to go
to the dwelling which she had described as her residence
and learn the cause of her disappointing me.
The house was in a miserable street some distance
from here, and I hurried along till I came to it. It
was a wretched-looking dwelling, such as none but
the very poorest class would have chosen. The door
stood open, and several ragged little Irish children
were playing upon the steps. I inquired of them if
Mrs. Benson, the seamstress lived there? They did
not seem to recognize the name—but they told me
that a young woman who took in sewing hired the
back rooms of the third-story. Following their direction,
I ascended three flights of stairs and found
myself at the door of the apartment, where I knocked,
and a faint voice bidding me enter, I unclosed the
door and stood upon the threshold. What a strange
and unexpected sight now met my gaze! Upon the
floor, almost at my feet as I entered, lay a young and
very beautiful girl apparently bereft of all consciousness.
She looked so thin and pale that at first I
thought her dead, and starting back in horror I was
about to leave the place, when a feeble voice, the
same which told me to come in, besought me to stay.
Looking round to discover whence it proceeded, I
saw the emaciated form of a man reclining upon a
couch in a distant part of the room. Hastily I approached
him, for I felt it to be my duty to render
what aid I could. As I drew nearer to his bedside, I
read the tale of confirmed disease in that pallid face
and in the wild sunken eyes whose gaze met my
own. In a few words he informed me that the
maiden who lay there senseless was his daughter.
While busily engaged at her work about an hour
previously, she had fallen from her seat and remained
thus in a state of unconsciousness. He said that his
limbs being palsied he was unable to help her, and so
he had lain upon his couch agonized by the thought
that his child was dead, or that she might die for want
of proper assistance. And he now besought me to
endeavor to discover if there were any signs of life,
and if possible to restore her to her senses. The appeal
was not in vain. I turned from him to his inanimate
daughter, and raising that light and fragile
form in my arms, placed her upon a couch in a small
closet-like apartment adjoining the one I had first entered.
For a long time every means of restoration
were vainly tried—but at length my strenuous efforts
were rewarded, and the young girl once more unclosed
her eyes. But she evidently recognized nothing
about her—those dark and strangely beautiful
orbs glared wildly around, while a few broken, incoherent
sentences burst from her lips, and as she sunk
again upon the pillow the bright fever flushes rushed
to her cheek, and I knew that her brain was suffering.
Great was her parent’s joy that she once more
breathed—but my heart was full of sadness, for I
could not help feeling that her life was in jeopardy.
It was my wish to have a physician summoned, but
I knew not how this was to be done, for I dared not
leave my charge, and there was no one near to help
me. At this moment I heard footsteps in the hall,
and quickly opening the door, beheld a boy ascending
the stairs. The promise of a piece of silver easily
procured his assent to go for the nearest doctor, and
accordingly he set off, while re-entering the room I
resumed my station by the sick girl’s bedside. In a
few minutes the physician arrived and my suspicions
of the nature of the young girl’s disorder were confirmed,
for he pronounced it to be a fever of the
brain, and said that his patient would require constant
watching and careful nursing. The father listened
anxiously and attentively to the doctor’s words.
His countenance fell as he caught the last sentences,
though he said not a word. It was not till after
giving his prescription, the physician left, promising
to call early on the morrow, that he spoke what was
passing in his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Julie must die!’ he said, bowing his head upon
his hands, while bitter, hopeless anguish was depicted
upon his face, ‘for I have no means of obtaining
for her the care she needs.’ It was all that passed
his lips, but it spoke volumes to my heart, and my
resolution was instantly taken. I told him that I
would not desert his child, that I would continue
with her part of the day, and when I was obliged to
leave that I would send some one to take my place.
Oh, Harry! if you could only have seen how grateful
that poor invalid looked! Most amply repaid was I
by that glance for whatever I had undertaken. I remained
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>
with the sick girl several hours longer, and
in the intervals when she slumbered, I had time to
observe the appearance of things around me. The
furniture was mean and scanty. There were but two
chairs in the room, and the carpet was worn almost
threadbare. Every thing betokened extreme poverty—but
neatness was plainly perceptible in the arrangements
of the apartment, and I felt from the appearance
of its occupants that they had seen more prosperous
days. A book lay upon a table close at hand,
I took it up, and discovered it to be a volume of
Bryant’s poems. On looking over the pages, I found
several of the most beautiful passages marked. Upon
one of the fly-leaves was <a id='write'></a>written, ‘To Julie—from
her father.’ The book was evidently the young girl’s
property. There was also a small portfolio of drawings
upon the table, which evinced signs of both
talent and cultivation. For an hour after the physician’s
departure the parent of Julie—for by her name
I may as well call her—showed little disposition to
converse. He seemed exhausted by the emotions of
the day—but I knew that though he said nothing, his
gaze was often upon me when he imagined that I did
not observe him. At last he roused himself to answer
some inquiries which I thought it necessary to
make. He told me that he was very poor, and that
for more than a year, during which his infirmity had
appeared and increased, his daughter had maintained
him by the proceeds of her needle. He said also that
two years previously he had resided at Baltimore as
one of its wealthiest merchants—but having failed
under circumstances that cast a cloud upon his character,
though he was in reality innocent of intentional
wrong, he had left the city of his birth and hastened
with Julie, his only child, to New York, where he
would be sure of never more meeting the scornful
gaze of those who had been his friends ere misfortune
overlook him. Here he hoped to procure employment—but
fate seemed against him. Shortly
after his arrival in this city, he was seized with a
dangerous illness which left him in his present helpless
condition, and his lovely and accomplished child
found herself very unexpectedly thrown upon her
own resources for her support and that of her invalid
parent. Bravely for many months had she borne the
burden, but continued anxiety concerning the means
of obtaining life’s necessaries had at last done its
work—and in the delirium of fever, the fair and noble
girl now tossed restlessly upon her bed, a mere wreck
of what she had once been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This brief sketch of their history, as you may
imagine, dear Harry, interested me greatly. And
when, at its conclusion, the speaker again expressed
his fears for the future and his doubts as to the recovery
of his child, for whom he had no power to provide
necessary attendance, I again assured him that
I would watch over her until she became quite well,
and that after this I would endeavor to find some
more healthy and suitable employment for her than
that in which she had latterly been engaged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Toward the close of the afternoon, being desirous
of going home for awhile, I dispatched the boy whom
I have once before mentioned, for Maggie, that she
might supply my place as attendant upon the sick
Julie, until evening, when I proposed to bear her
company and resume my post at the bedside. She
came, and her sympathies were soon all enlisted by
the tale which I hurriedly repeated to her. But she
decidedly opposed my wish to return—reminded me
of my late indisposition, and declaring that I was not
strong enough to bear the fatigue of sitting up all
night, insisted upon being allowed to exercise her
skill as nurse without any other assistance. I
thanked her for her consideration, while I felt that
she was right. So I left her and proceeded home,
where, as you may suppose, I was welcomed most
joyfully by little Willie and his sister, who had mourned
incessantly over mamma’s protracted absence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, Harry, that I have finished my somewhat
lengthy narrative, tell me whether you approve
of what I have done and promised to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, dearest Alice,” replied Mr. Colman,
affectionately pressing the little hand that rested
within his own, “while you continue to follow, as
you have hitherto done, the dictates of your own
pure, loving heart, I can never do aught but applaud
you. The present objects of your benevolence, are
I am sure from the account, well worthy of whatever
you may do for them, and I would advise you to persevere
in your efforts for their welfare. But you
quite forgot to tell me, my dear, if you discovered in
your <span class='it'>protégé</span> the seamstress for whom you were
searching.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed,” she replied, while her countenance
wore a look of vexation, “<span class='it'>my</span> seamstress was a very
different sort of a being from this beautiful Julie. Nor
do I think that I shall ever discover her, for just before
I returned home I made inquiries as to whether
a person answering her description lived in that
house, and was assured that no one of that name had
ever dwelt there. How foolish I was to trust those
dresses to an entire stranger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And pray what may be the name of the family
whose history has interested you so deeply?” asked
Mr. Colman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The father’s name is Malcolm—Walter Malcolm,
as he informed me. With the daughter’s I believe
that I have already acquainted you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Walter Malcolm! Julie Malcolm! And you say
they are from Baltimore?” As he spoke Mr. Colman’s
cheek grew suddenly pale, and rising from his
seat he paced the apartment with a hasty and agitated
step.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what is the matter, Harry?” exclaimed his
wife in a tone of the deepest solicitude, as she sprung
to his side, “pray tell me what has moved you
thus?” But it was some moments ere he seemed
able to reply. At length with emotion he said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alice, what if I were to tell you that this man—this
Walter Malcolm is my brother—the brother who
in my early youth drove me away from his luxurious
home, an orphan and unprotected, to seek my
fortune in the wide, wide world?” Alice Colman
started and raised her eyes wonderingly to her husband’s
face, and after a brief silence he resumed with
a sternness unusual to him—</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>
“In that hour, Alice—in that hour of utter desolation,
when lonely and uncared for I left my brother’s
roof forever, a fierce, burning desire for revenge
took possession of my soul. In the first bitterness of
despair I called upon Heaven to avenge my wrongs.
I wished that Walter’s wealth might take to itself
wings—that one day he might come to me for bread;
and I resolved were this ever the case, to give him—a
stone! My desire has been fulfilled, and my proud
and unfeeling brother is now a beggar at my door!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused—while his wife shuddered and looked
appealingly up into his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harry!” she exclaimed in a low, earnest tone,
“you surely do not mean that you will not forgive
the sorrow your brother’s conduct once caused you—that
you will now look exultingly upon his woes, and
turn a deaf ear to the wants of his sweet and suffering
child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reproving expression of the dear face now
anxiously upturned to his, at once recalled the husband
to a sense of error, and drawing the form of the
beloved one closer to his side, he said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! how fervently should I thank Heaven who
has given to me such a monitor in the hour of temptation!
Pardon me, my Alice, if by giving way to
impulse I have wounded your sensitive spirit, and
that in the moment when passion held its sway, I
slighted the divine lesson of forgiveness, through
your influence first impressed upon my soul. Nay,
dearest, look not thus surprised, for it was really by
your means that the wish to quell the thirst for revenge
upon my brother, entered my heart; and if you
will listen a few seconds I can explain to you the
words that at present may well seem mysterious.
You will doubtless remember, Alice, that some
months before our marriage, I experienced a severe
fit of illness. One pleasant Sabbath evening shortly
after I was declared convalescent, I was reclining
upon a sofa in the sitting-room at your uncle’s residence.
My spirits were just then very much depressed—I
felt inwardly fretful and uneasy—and as
is not uncommon at such a time, many little circumstances
which before had been almost forgotten, rose
up in my mind, and woke anew in my bosom sensations
according to their nature, of pain, anxiety, or
indignation. Among other things came forcibly to
view the memory of the grievous wrong I had received
at the hands of him who should have been a
parent to me; and a feeling of the deepest hatred toward
my brother stole to my heart, together with a
hope that at some future time a chance might be
mine of returning him measure for measure of the
unkindness which he had so unsparingly dealt out to
me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At that instant, Alice, you re-entered the room
from which you had been a few minutes absent, and
at the request of your uncle, opened the family Bible
and began your usual Sabbath-evening duty of reading
a series of chapters from the holy book. There
was a passage in the first which you read that affected
me strangely—for it came as a reproof from Heaven
delivered to me through the medium of one of earth’s
angels. It was the following—‘Avenge not yourselves,
but rather give place unto wrath, for it is
written, vengeance is mine; I will repay saith the
Lord. Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed him;
if he thirst, give him drink; for in so doing thou shalt
heap coals of fire on his head.’ The sentences awed
me, coming upon my ear as they did at a period
when my spirit needed the precious warning and rebuke
contained in them, and I breathed a silent
prayer to Heaven for strength to enable me to heed
it. The hour of my trial has arrived, and to-day
have I again felt the promptings of the tempter. You
cannot imagine with what force these old feelings
have been driven back upon my soul, but, Alice, your
voice has once more stilled the tempest, and I know
that I have passed the ordeal in safety.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry Colman ceased, and this time as his gaze
met that of his companion he saw that her eyes were
full of tears—but they were tears of grateful joy.
For a little while there was silence between them,
but at length Mr. Colman continued:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me recount to you, Alice, as briefly as possible,
a few circumstances connected with my early
history. I have never done so before, because the
effort was a painful one, and there was no exact necessity
for the repetition. As you are aware, I was
so unfortunate as to lose my father when I was a
mere infant, and my mother lived only till I had attained
my twelfth year. I was the child of her
second marriage, and she had one son by a previous
union who was many years my senior. At the period
of my mother’s death, my brother, Walter Malcolm,
had been married nearly five years, and was
now a widower and the father of one little girl, who
had just reached her third summer. Upon her death-bed
my parent left me beneath his care, desiring
Walter to attend to my wants and to be kind and
gentle to me when she was no more. As soon as the
funeral was over, my brother took me with him to
his own dwelling. I was now entirely dependent
upon him for maintenance. Walter Malcolm was
wealthy, for a large estate had descended to him from
his father, who had also left my mother a life-annuity,
which while she lived had supported us. At her
death I was of course unprovided for, for my own
father had possessed no worldly goods to bequeath
me. My new home seemed very different to me
from the hearth of my early, sunny childhood. I was
lonely and desolate—for between Walter and myself
brotherly love had never existed. Not that <span class='it'>I</span> would
have denied him his meed—but I was too proud to
award the gift that I was confident would never be
valued, for my memory could not boast a single instance
wherein he had evinced for me the slightest
regard. Nay, I even felt that I was an object of dislike
to him, though I knew not the cause. During
my mother’s life I had been greatly indulged, and it
was scarcely to be wondered at that I was frequently
very wayward. Upon such occasions, a word of
love had always been sufficient to control my passionate
nature; but when the sweet affectionate tones
that ever had power to calm me, were hushed in the
tomb, my faults were met by my new guardian with
harshness and contempt, and this never failed to
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>
rouse a spirit of continued opposition. There was
but one voice in my brother’s household that ever
spoke lovingly to me. It was that of his child—the
little Julie. From the first hour of my residence beneath
Walter’s roof, the little creature had conceived
a passionate attachment to me, preferring my presence
to that of her nurse or even her father. And,
as you may imagine, Alice, I did not slight her proffered
affection, and during the three years that we
dwelt together the little one was the sole sunbeam
upon my shadowed life-path. How gladly did I
greet her graceful bounding step! How dear was
the sound of her clear ringing laughter as I joined in
her sports!—and more precious still were the moments
when weary of play, she would steal to my
side, and twining her tiny arms about my neck, murmur
forth, in lisping accents, her sweet child-like
terms of endearment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had reached my fifteenth year when the incident
occurred that separated me from my brother.
An error was laid to my charge of which I was
really guiltless—and as I proudly refused to acknowledge
and repair the fault—Walter Malcolm turned
me from his dwelling, declaring that thenceforth and
forever he disowned me! Time was merely given
me to collect a few little articles that I could really
call my own—I was not allowed to bid farewell to
the child whom I yearned to look upon once more
before I went—and so, an outcast, I passed from that
stately mansion. Alice, I dare not linger over a description
of my sensations in that hour of anguish—for
it might perhaps arouse them again within my
soul. You know the rest of my history—the circumstance
of my adoption by your uncle who was
then visiting Baltimore, and first beheld me in a store
where I had entered in quest of employment. To him
I confided the facts relating to my former life; he pitied
and sympathized with me, and bore me with him to
his own home in this city, and from that day was in

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_8'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The morning succeeding the events last recorded,
at an early hour, Mrs. Colman was on her way to the
dwelling of the now destitute and infirm Walter
Malcolm. She had new motives for the advancement
of her charitable purposes, and her interest in
the sick girl had deepened since she knew her to be
the one whose infant steps her own husband had
guided. Hastening up the stairs she knocked at the
door, which was soon opened by Maggie, who looked
weary enough with the fatigue of the past night.
The young girl had been very restless, she said, and
she believed that the fever was rapidly progressing.
“But is she not a beautiful creature?” remarked
Maggie to her mistress, as she bent over the couch
and parted the rich curls from the fevered brow,
“ah, ma’am, I have nursed many a one before this
in sickness—but never a person whose appearance
so won upon me as hers has.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice Colman did not wonder at the observation—but
as she now glanced round the room she met the
gaze of Julie’s father, and her morning salutation to
him was full of gentleness and sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the whole of that day Mrs. Colman maintained
her station in the chamber of sickness and poverty.
The physician came at the appointed hour,
and gave it as his opinion that Julie was growing
rapidly worse and that there were even doubts
whether in any case her life would be spared. Oh!
how the thought of her dying affected Mrs. Colman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let every thing be done that may be of benefit to
her,” she said anxiously to the doctor, “spare no expense
whatever if you think you can by any means
preserve her from the grasp of death. I will be answerable
for whatever remuneration you may require.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And not even content with his advice, she sent for
her own family physician determined to try all the
means she could for the preservation of the life of
her husband’s niece. She noticed that Walter Malcolm
looked very pale all day, but attributed it to
anxiety for his daughter. He seemed too languid to
converse—but once, as she handed him a glass of
water, he said—“Lady, Heaven will reward your
kindness to the suffering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening when Alice Colman returned home,
her husband surprised her with the intelligence that
Walter Malcolm was aware of her relationship to
him. Before she went there in the morning, Mr.
Colman had advised her on no account to allow his
brother to suspect from whom he received the needful
aid, for he feared that Walter still entertained
against him the old feeling of hatred, and that it would
awaken unpleasant emotions in his heart if he knew
that the brother he had deserted was now destined to
be his chief reliance. But the caution to his wife
was unnecessary. Walter Malcolm had made inquiries
of Maggie concerning the family to whom he
was indebted, and from their minuteness Harry Colman
was confident that he had been recognised.
And that his brother had not forgotten his former
aversion to him he deemed evident from the fact that
he had said nothing of his discovery, during the day,
to Mrs. Colman. The latter however thought differently.
Julie’s father had spoken his thanks for that
draught of water too earnestly for her to join in her
husband’s belief, and she expressed her conviction
that he repented his past conduct, and that he merely
wanted courage to confess his penitence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But day after day passed on, and yet there was no
allusion to the subject on the part of Walter Malcolm.
Meanwhile his daughter had passed the crisis of the
fever and was declared convalescent. If the appearance
of Julie Malcolm in the hour of delirium had
attracted the fancy of Alice Colman and her nurse,
how much more were they drawn toward her when
her mind was freed from the chains that bound it—for
gentle and loving-hearted, her grateful spirit
manifested itself in various little touching ways toward
those who had watched over her during her
dangerous illness. When she grew stronger and was
able to enter into conversation, a perfect understanding
arose between Mrs. Colman and herself that they
were always to be friends. Alice Colman felt that
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>
she already loved Julie dearly—and the latter was
not slow in returning the affection of one whose
timely succor had saved her life. Still the young girl
suspected not that they were kindred by law as in
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was soon settled that when Julie became entirely
recovered, she should undertake the duties of
governess to Mrs. Colman’s children, and this new
office was to afford her the means of support. A
more suitable residence had been sought by Alice
Colman for Julie and her father, and they were to remove
into it as soon as the former had gained sufficient
strength to bear the fatigue. Two more weeks
elapsed ere this last project was effected—and they
were then comfortably settled in their new abode.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And still there was no sign from Walter Malcolm
that he knew of his brother’s agency in the change
wrought in his affairs. He was now generally reserved
when Mrs. Colman was near, and his countenance
often wore a deep shade of gloom.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_9'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The first day that Julie Malcolm felt equal to the
exertion was spent at the house of her new friend,
and then it was that for the first time since her childhood,
Harry Colman beheld his niece. So strongly
impressed upon his mind was the recollection of her
early fondness for him, and the soothing influence
which her winning, affectionate ways had possessed
over his spirit, that had he now obeyed the voice of
impulse he would fain have clasped Julie once more
to his heart; for though he now looked upon a beautiful
and graceful maiden of eighteen, he could
scarcely view her in any other light than as the darling
child whose caresses had so often comforted him
when greeted by every other voice with coldness.
Yet recalling the fact that their relationship could not
be breathed to her by himself, he was obliged to meet
her with the reserve of a perfect stranger. But all
formality between them soon vanished, and an hour
after their introduction found them conversing together
with the ease of old acquaintanceship. Nor
had Julie forgotten, in her own frank earnest manner,
to thank him again and again for the services his
family had rendered her father and herself—while her
soft dark eyes filled with tears as she spoke of the
debt which by gratitude only she could repay.
Harry Colman longed to tell her that <span class='it'>he</span> was the
debtor—and that by his wife’s attention to her, Julie
had but been rewarded for the love she had accorded
him when all other hearts were steeled against him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Colman saw with delight her husband’s increasing
predeliction for his niece—for by renewing
his former affection for Julie, she hoped to make the
young girl at some future day, the instrument of reconciliation
between the estranged brothers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day of Julie’s visit to the Colmans was a
happy one to all parties. Even little Effie Colman
and her brother Willie, though at first rather shy of
the lady, who, as they were told, was to initiate
them into the mysteries of the primer, had become
very fond of her, and were exceedingly loath to let
her go when the time appointed for her return home
arrived. Then, with her arms entwined about Julie’s
neck, little Effie besought her to say when she was
coming to them daily—and the following week was
accordingly named for the commencement of her
career as preceptress to the children.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_10'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The morning agreed upon by Julie and Mrs. Colman
for the beginning of the former’s labors arrived,
but the young girl did not appear. Knowing well
her eagerness to enter upon her new duties—the eagerness
of a noble spirit to throw off the yoke of dependence—Alice
Colman might well feel anxious at
Julie’s non-fulfillment of her promise. For the first
time a thought crossed her mind that the suspicions
of her husband concerning his brother’s continued ill-feeling
toward him, might be just, and that Walter
Malcolm had resolved to oppose his daughter’s constant
association with them. But not long would she
allow herself to imagine thus. Perhaps Julie was ill
again—or some unforeseen circumstances had prevented
her coming. So Mrs. Colman determined to
wait till the following day, when if the object of her
solicitude was still absent, and she received no message
from her, she felt that she would then be more
capable of judging the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not until near the close of the afternoon
that she was relieved of uncertainty upon the subject
by the reception of a note from Julie. The latter
stated that her father was very ill of a dangerous
fever, brought on, as the physician averred, by distress
of mind—and that it was doubtful whether in
his enfeebled condition he could live a week longer.
She added that only a few hours previously he had
informed her that their benefactress was the wife of
his brother, and also of the unfeeling treatment which
that brother had received from him. And Julie said
that from the hour when he had learned the circumstance
of their relationship, remorse and the knowledge
of his unworthiness to accept assistance from
the one whom he had injured, preyed upon her father’s
spirits, and at last caused the fever that threatened
soon to terminate his existence. His last
earthly wish now was to see his brother and ask forgiveness
of the past—and Julie concluded by begging
Mrs. Colman to use all her influence in order to
bring her uncle to her parent’s couch, if it were possible,
that very evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that evening Mr. Colman, accompanied his
wife to the abode of Walter Malcolm. The meeting
between the brothers was a painful one. There
was mingled shame and penitential sorrow on the
part of the elder, while the countenance of the
younger was expressive of the deepest agitation as
he stood by the bedside of him who had cast so dark
a cloud upon his youth. Harry Colman had yielded
to the entreaties of Alice for this interview, while he
felt that it would have been wrong to have denied it—but
it was not until he looked upon Walter’s pallid
face, and heard that once stern and familiar voice
supplicating forgiveness, even with the humble
avowal that it was undeserved, that the lingering
spark of resentment was entirely extinguished within
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>
his breast—and when he breathed the much-desired
word of pardon they were truly heart-felt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And by returning good for evil he had indeed
“heaped coals of fire” upon the head of his brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From your birth, Harry, you were the object of
my bitterest envy and hatred,” was the confession
of Walter Malcolm, “for upon you was freely lavished
the love of that mother whose affection I had
never possessed. She had been forced by her family
into a union with my father while her heart was another’s—and
when her husband died and she was
free to wed again, she married the one who had first
gained her regard. This was the key to your superior
claim upon our mother’s love. I will not now
blame her for the wrong of partiality, though it was
the basis of my demeanor toward yourself. I should
have had sufficient strength of mind to have resisted
its influence—but in this I was sadly deficient. To
the last hour of her life my mother’s chief thought
was of you. Yes, even in her dying moments her principal
anxiety was for <span class='it'>your</span> future happiness, while
there was but little reference to the welfare of her
eldest child. When she was no more, and you came
to dwell beneath my roof, I scrupled not openly to
show the sentiments which during our parent’s life-time
I was obliged to conceal. And I had now an
additional cause of dislike. I secretly accused you
of robbing me of the affection of my little girl, who,
as you will perhaps remember, always manifested a
decided preference for your society. I did not reflect
that my manner toward her was often cold and distant,
and widely different from your own; and with
such feelings of jealousy concerning you in my
heart, it was scarcely to be wondered that I seized
the first opportunity of ridding myself of your presence.
Though I knew you to be guiltless of the
fault for which I blamed you, I drove you from my
dwelling, refusing from that moment to own you as
a brother. Nor did I then experience the least remorse
for the act—and during the years that followed
I strove to forget that you had ever existed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was only within the past twelvemonth, when
surrounded by poverty, and the victim of an incurable
malady, that as I lay restlessly upon my bed, the
memory of my cruel conduct toward my innocent
brother has pressed heavily upon my mind. Often
have I busied my brain with vain conjectures respecting
your fate—whether you still lived—and if
you had escaped the whirlpool of crime and sin
within which the young and unadvised are but too
frequently engulfed. When I thought, as I sometimes
did, that you might have fallen—my sensations were
those of the most acute anguish, for I felt that the sin
would all be mine, and that at the judgment day I
should be called to the throne of God to hear him
pronounce the fearful penalty for the murder of a
brother’s soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At length, through the illness of my daughter, who
was very unexpectedly thrown upon the benevolence
of your wife, I obtained from your servant some information
concerning the family to whom I owed so
much, and discovered in the hand stretched forth to
aid my child, the wife of my discarded brother. It
would be vain to attempt a description of my emotions
as I learned this fact. Joy that you were not
forever lost, predominated—and then was added
shame, and a consciousness of my own unworthiness
to receive the benefits which henceforth you daily
conferred upon me, as I felt that you must have
recognized me—for I had given to your wife an account
of my previous life. Each successive service
lavished upon my family by your own, sunk like a
weight of lead upon my heart, while as I saw how
generously you repaid me for the evil I had committed
against you, I longed to cast myself at your feet
and supplicate forgiveness. But one thought deterred
me. It was the fear that you might deem me actuated
by interested motives—by the desire to leave my
daughter at my death under the care of her now
wealthy uncle. And so, for a time, I set aside the
yearning for a reconciliation. But it returned with
double force when this, which I know will be my
last illness, came upon me, and I felt that I could not
die happily without hearing from your lips a pardon
for my misdeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weeping Julie had stood by the bedside listening
attentively as her father spoke, one hand resting
affectionately in her uncle’s, while the other was
clasped in that of his wife. Though scarcely six
years old when Harry Colman was dismissed from
his brother’s house, she had ever retained a vivid recollection
of the event. She remembered how passionately
she had wept when told by her nurse that
she would probably never again behold her favorite,
and how indignant she had felt when they said that it
was owing to his own naughty conduct he had been
sent away—while her ignorance of the fact that her
uncle’s name was not the same as her father’s prevented
a recognition of him when they again met.</p>

<hr class='tbk112'/>

<p class='pindent'>Walter Malcolm survived a week after the scene
just described. Having made his peace with earthly
objects, his last hours were devoted to solemn preparations
for a future state, looking trustfully for the
mercy of Him who listens kindly to the prayer of the
penitent. His brother was constantly with him till
his eyes were forever closed in the death-slumber;
and from the day when the remains of her father
were borne to their last resting-place, the orphan
Julie found a home with her uncle, to whose pleasant
hearth she was lovingly welcomed, while by every
kind and sympathizing attention her relatives strove
to alleviate the sorrow for a parent’s loss, which at
first seemed almost insupportable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Power, consequence, importance, greatness, are
relative terms; they denote position or attainment,
comparable with some other. And hence a queen is
a queen at the head of a band of gipsies as much as
if she sat upon a throne, at the head of a nation
whose morning drum beats an eternal <span class='it'>reveille</span>. It
was <a id='there'></a>therefore, and for another cause yet to be told,
that I lifted my hat with particular deference when
I opened suddenly upon the head woman of a gipsy
tribe, as I was passing through a small piece of
woodland. Though, truth to say, I had been looking
at her for some time, an hour previous, as she was
giving some directions to one or two of her ragged
and dirty train. Now I had known that woman in
other circumstances. I had seen her in the family,
had heard her commended by the men for her graceful
movements, and berated by the women for exhibiting
those movements to the men, and being as
free with her tongue in presence of her female superiors
as she had been with her feet before her male
admirers. But neither the admiration of the men nor
the rebuke of the women produced any effect. All
that this woman received from a long sojourn with
the people of the village, was a little loss of the darkness
of the skin, and a pretty good understanding of
the wants and weaknesses of society. Everybody
knew that she had been left in exchange for a healthful
child—and some years before it had been discovered
that the healthful child would be worth nothing
to the gipsies, and the gipsy girl would, at the
first opportunity, return to her “brethren and kindred
according to the flesh.” And such was the skill
which she manifested on her return, such her ability
to direct, such her knowledge of the wants of the
villagers, and her power to take advantage of these
wants, that she became the head of the tribe with
which she was associated, and might have directed
numerous tribes, could they have been collected for
her guidance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could not learn that there was much of a story
connected with the life of the queen, much indeed
that would interest the general reader. But she was
a woman—and her heart, a mystery to the uninitiated,
would, if exposed, have been worth a world’s perusal.
A woman’s heart—alas! how few are admitted
to loose the seals and open that secret volume!
How very few could understand the revelation if it
were made. I could not, I confess; and it is only
when a peculiar light is thrown upon here and there
a pace, that I can acquire even a partial knowledge
of what is manifested. The Queen of the Gipsies,
though elevated by right, and sustained by knowledge,
was no less a woman than a queen. She could and
did command male and female, old and young. She
was treated with all that marked distinction which,
even among her rude people, continues to be paid to
preeminence. And while she sought to do the best
for all, she received all this homage with that ease,
and that apparent absence of wonder, which denote
the right to distinction—this was a part of her queenly
character admirably sustained, natural, easy, dignified.
But the queen was a <span class='it'>woman</span>. I had heard her
give orders, which sent certain of the most active of
the young, male and female, to the other side of the
village, and then she gave employment to the old and
the young in the moving hamlet, and seeing the first
depart, and the last busy, she left the camp, and took
her way through the wood. I followed her and
traced her rapid steps to the burying-ground of the
town, which stood a distance from any dwelling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seating myself out of view, I saw the queen walk
directly to a recently sodded grave, upon which she
looked down for a moment, and then clasping her
hands wildly above her head she threw herself with
a subdued cry upon the grave. I was too far from
her to distinguish all the words of her lament, but
they were wild and agonizing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a short time the woman arose, and said with
a distinct, clear voice, “With thee and for thee I
could have endured the mockery of their boasted
civilization, and suffered the ceremonies of their
tame creed. With thee and for thee I would have
foregone my native tribe and my hereditary rights.
So persuasive was thy affection that I could have
forgotten—or at least would not have boasted—that
I was of the glorious race that knows no manacles of
body or of mind, but what it chooses to impose. But
thou art gone, and with thee all my attraction to the
idle, wearisome life of thy race. I have returned to
my people, and I may lead them, and power and
activity may for a time weaken my agony. I need
no longer sacrifice my love for my race—but yet one
sacrifice I will make, and thy grave shall be the
altar. With thee my heart is buried. To thee do I
here swear an eternal fidelity—and year by year
will I lead my tribe hither, that I may pour out my
anguish upon the sod that rises above thee. And I
may hope that such devotion may lead the spirit that
made our race for future happiness as for present
freedom, to give thee back to me when I enter on
my world of changeless love and glorious recompense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kneeling again, the Gipsy Queen kissed the grave,
and gathered a few blades of grass and one or two
flowers, shook away the tears which she had let fall
upon them, and placing them in her bosom turned
and left the burying-place, and proceeded toward the
camp. I left my position by the other route, and
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>
passing through the wood I met her. Her face was
cleared from every cloud, no trace of a tear was evident;
she had prepared herself to meet her party in
a way to excite no inquiry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little that I knew of the Gipsy Queen previous
to that day, and what was told me by one who had
lived in the village very long, I have set down. I
never saw her after I passed her in the woods. But
she made an impression on my mind that will not be
easily removed. And she bore in her heart motives
for action which few but herself and me will ever
know.</p>

<p class='line'>One moment more, beneath the old elm, Mary,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Where last we parted in the flowing dell—</p>
<p class='line'>One moment more through twilight tints that vary,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;To gaze upon thy grave, and then, farewell!</p>
<p class='line'>Ere from this spot, and these loved scenes I sever,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Where still thy lovely spirit seems to stray—</p>
<p class='line'>One look—to fix them on my soul forever—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And then away!</p>

<p class='line'>Mary, I know my steps should now be shrinking</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;From this sad spot—but on my mournful gaze</p>
<p class='line'>A scene floats up that sets my soul to thinking</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;On all the dear delights of other days!</p>
<p class='line'>I’m gazing on the little foot-bridge yonder</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Thrown o’er the stream whose waters purl below,</p>
<p class='line'>Where I so oft have seen thee pause and ponder,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Leaning thy white brow on thy hand of snow.</p>
<p class='line'>I’m standing on the spot where last we parted,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Where, as I left thee in the fragrant dell,</p>
<p class='line'>I saw thee turn so oft—half broken-hearted—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Waving thy hand in token of farewell.</p>
<p class='line'>I start to meet thy footstep light and airy—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;But—the cold grass waves o’er thy sweet young head;</p>
<p class='line'>Would that the shroud that wraps thy fair form, Mary,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Wrapped mine instead!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>In vain my heart its bitter thoughts would parry,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;An adder’s grasp about its chords seem curled,</p>
<p class='line'>For you were all I ever thought of, Mary—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Were all I doted on in this wide world!</p>
<p class='line'>And yet, I’d sigh not while thy fate I ponder,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Did memory only bring thee to my eyes</p>
<p class='line'>Pale as thou sleepest in the church-yard yonder—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Or as an angel dazzling from the skies!</p>
<p class='line'>I then at least could treasure each sweet token</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Of thy pure love—and in life’s mad’ning whirl</p>
<p class='line'>Steel my crushed heart—had not thine own been broken,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Poor hapless girl!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>But, Mary—Mary, when I think upon thee,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;As when I last beheld thee in thy pride—</p>
<p class='line'>And on the fate—oh God!—to which he won thee—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;I curse the hour that sent me from your side!</p>
<p class='line'>Oh why wert thou so richly, strangely gifted</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;With mortal loveliness beyond compare?</p>
<p class='line'>The look of love beneath thy lashes lifted—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Its fatal sweetness was to thee a snare!</p>
<p class='line'>Yet sleep, my sister—I will not upbraid thee—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Thou wert too sweet—too innocently dear;</p>
<p class='line'>But he—the exulting demon who betrayed thee—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;He lives, he lives, and I am loitering here!</p>
<p class='line'>Even now some happier fair one’s chains may bind him</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;In dalliance sweet—but I’ll avenge thee well!</p>
<p class='line'>Avenge thee?—Yes! a brother’s curse will find him,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Though he should dive into the deeps of hell!</p>
<p class='line'>I swear it, sister—as thou art forgiven—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;By all our wrongs—by all our severed ties,</p>
<p class='line'>And by the blessedness of yon blue heaven,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;That gives its world of azure to mine eyes!</p>
<p class='line'>By all my love—by every sacred duty</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;A brother owes—and by yon heaving sod,</p>
<p class='line'>Thine early grave—and by thy blighted beauty,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Thou sweetest angel in the realms of God!</p>
<p class='line'>I swear it, by the bursting groans I smother,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And call on Heaven and thee to nerve me now.</p>
<p class='line'>Mary, look down!—behold thy wretched brother,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And bless the vow!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Sister, my soul its last farewell is taking,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And I for this had thought it nerved to-night,</p>
<p class='line'>But every chord about my heart seems breaking,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;And blinding tears shut out the glimmering sight.</p>
<p class='line'>One look—one last long look to hill and meadow—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;To the old foot-bridge and the murmuring mill,</p>
<p class='line'>And to the church-yard sleeping in the shadow—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Cease tears—and let these fond eyes look their fill!</p>
<p class='line'>One look—and now farewell ye scenes that vary</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Beneath the twilight shades that round me flow!</p>
<p class='line'>The charm that bound my wild heart here, was Mary—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And she lies low!</p>

therefore, if I question the infallibility of the Pope, summon me not before the Inquisition; if I speak treason against
the king, clap me not up in the Tower; and if I utter heresy against the ladies, let me not be flayed alive by the nails
of enraged damsels. <span class='sc'>Old Play.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no use in wasting words, Cousin
Charles; you never can persuade me that men love
more devotedly than women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you be so unreasonable, Anne? I only
want to convince you that affection being an essential
part of woman’s nature, she cannot help loving
something or somebody all her life. The most she
does, even in her most intense devotion, is to <span class='it'>individualize</span>
the general sentiment which pervades her
character; but when men love, they actually take up
a new nature, and concentrate upon it all their
strength of mind and force of character.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have certainly a droll method of reasoning,
cousin; because women are <span class='it'>loving</span> creatures, therefore
they cannot love as well as the rougher sex.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are willful, Anne, and are determined not
to understand me. I mean that love is usually a
habitude with women, while with men, if it exists
at all, it is a positive, determinate thing—a graft, as
it were, upon their sturdy natures, and partaking
therefore of the strength of the stock which nourishes
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you say so when men are always in
love, from the time they quit the nursery until they
are gray-headed, or <span class='it'>married</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such attachments are mere fancies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray, how is one to distinguish between a fancy
and a fact in so delicate a matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is difficult to decide at first, because in their inceptive
state they are much alike; but time is the
true test. A fancy, a mere intoxication of the senses,
is scarce worth talking about; but in a genuine manly
love there is a depth, a fervor, a disinterestedness, a
devotion, such as woman can never feel—nay, which
they can rarely appreciate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heresy—rank heresy—Cousin Charles. I appeal
to Uncle Lorimer, who has heard our whole discussion,
if you do not deserve excommunication with
‘bell, book and candle,’ for holding such opinions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cousins were sitting together in the twilight,
and, as the shadows of evening deepened around
them, the light of the soft-coal fire in the polished
grate gave a beautifully cheerful look of home comfort
to the pleasant apartment. An old gentleman,
whose silver hair glittered in the fire-light, had been
sitting in the chimney-nook, and, thus appealed to by
his merry niece, he smiled good-humoredly as he
replied—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you submit the dispute to me, I must decide
against both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you are both too generalizing in your
remarks. In this work-a-day world of ours there is
a daily and hourly need of the tender, watchful,
kindly ministry of sympathy and affection; now the
peculiar attributes of woman’s nature are such as fit
her for this ministry; and whether it be a mere
habitude or not, it is the quality most needed by men
and most generally possessed by women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anne clapped her hands, and looked triumphantly
at her cousin; but Uncle Lorimer continued—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must agree with Charles, however, that when
men give out their whole strength to a genuine affection,
it is a more unselfish, magnanimous and higher
emotion than ever could dwell in the bosom of
woman. The same qualities which make her the
gentler half of man mingle their leaven in her affections.
For instance, a woman will make any sacrifice
for one whom she loves, she will bear all kinds
of privation and suffering for his sake, but earth
holds not the creature more pitilessly exacting of
affection than she is, or more jealously awake to
every whisper of distrust. Another weakness in her
character is vanity; and I must confess I never yet
found a woman so much in love with her lover, that
she would not curl her hair and dress in her best to
meet the eyes of other men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! uncle. You are worse than Charles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But perhaps you will like to hear my whole
opinion, Anne. I have said that women possess
most of the quality which is required in daily life;
as I am not one of those who pretend to despise <span class='it'>good
habits</span> because they are not <span class='it'>heroic virtues</span>, I think
you ought to be satisfied with my decision.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you attribute so much nobler a quality to
men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is true, but let me comfort you by just
whispering in your ear, that not one man in a thousand
is capable of such an affection. True sentiment
is the rarest thing upon earth. To use the

<p class='noindent'>often bring together hearts which habit afterward
keeps united. Few, very few, create an ideal in
their youth and see it substantialize into a reality
as life goes on. Still fewer of those men who
are capable of real love ever bestow its treasures
upon one who can appreciate them. I think I have
never known a single instance of such an attachment
being reciprocated and rewarded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever know more than one man who possessed
this faculty of loving, uncle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>
“In the course of my long life I have known <span class='it'>three</span>;
and if you choose I will tell you the history of one
of these, to prove my theory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Among my earliest school friends and playmates
were Edgar and Herbert Darsie. They were twin-brothers,
the only children of a widow, whom I remember
as a tall, pale lady in close mourning, which
she never laid aside till the day of her death. There
was little of that resemblance between the twins
which generally makes the pleasant puzzle of mothers
and nurses in similar cases; for, though alike
in feature and height, and even in their peculiarity
of gait and manner, yet Edgar had the fair complexion,
blue eyes, and light silken hair of his mother;
while Herbert’s olive complexion, dark eyes,
and curling black locks betrayed the French blood
which he derived from his father. They were cheerful,
happy-tempered boys, and possessed a certain
natural sweetness of manner, which made them universal
favorites with old and young. Their mother
lived in the retired but handsome style which, in
those days, was considered the proper mode of
showing respect for the memory of a husband. She
kept up the establishment exactly as it had been
during Mr. Darsie’s life, and seemed to find her only
pleasure in doing precisely as he would have wished.
She was apparently in the enjoyment of a handsome
income, kept her carriage, and had a number of servants,
while the house and grounds exhibited taste
as well as no stint of expense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boys were about twelve years of age, when
an accident happened to Herbert, which, though apparently
slight at first, finally led to the most disastrous
consequences. While skating, he fell and received
some injury, which, after months of suffering, finally
developed itself in an incurable disease of the spine,
entailing upon him a life-time of pain, and branding
him with frightful deformity. The tall, lithe, graceful
boy, whose step had been as light and free as the
leap of the greyhound, was now a dwarfed and distorted
cripple. As soon as he was able to leave his
sick-room, Mrs. Darsie placed Edgar at boarding-school,
and sailed for Europe, with the intention of
giving Herbert the benefit of all the modern discoveries
in medicine. She designed to be absent a year,
but, led on by fallacious hopes, she traveled farther,
and remained much longer than she had anticipated.
Three years elapsed before her return, and to all appearance
Herbert had derived little benefit from the
various experiments to which he had been subjected.
He was still dependent on his crutch, and his gnarled
and stunted figure presented a pitiable contrast to the
tall and well-knit form of his brother. But his health
was somewhat improved; his paroxysms of pain
were less frequent, and he could now enjoy weeks
of comparative ease and comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The brothers had early been remarkable for their
affection for each other, and their unbroken concord,
but their long separation had not been without its
effect upon them. Edgar was gay, active, volatile,
and not destitute of a leaven of selfishness; while
Herbert had become grave, quiet, gentle in manner,
and most thoughtful and considerate for others. To
him suffering had been a teacher of all good things,
and the misfortune of being cut off from fellowship
with the world had taught him to find resources
within himself. He could not and did not expect
Edgar to sympathize in all his tastes, for he was
conscious that their paths must henceforth be divided
ones. He schooled himself to overcome the pang
which this reflection gave to his sensitive spirit, and
tried to find in his brother’s enjoyments of outer life,
a pleasure which he could only receive from the
reflection of another’s joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soon after their return from Europe, Mrs. Darsie
received into her family the orphan child of a poor
clergyman, partly from charity, partly with a view
to furnish a companion and attendant for Herbert.
Jessie Graham was a pale, delicate-looking child,
about twelve years old, when she took up her abode
with her benefactress. Her thin and almost transparent
cheek, her bloodless lips, and large gray,
timid-looking eyes, spoke of fragile health, and of a
certain shyness of character which might be the result
of early anxieties, or perhaps denoted feebleness
of mind and indecision. But she was a sweet-tempered,
gentle little girl, and her compassion for
Herbert’s melancholy condition soon dissipated her
shyness toward him, though to every one else, even
to Mrs. Darsie, she was as timid as a startled fawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To divert his lonely hours Herbert undertook her
instruction. He was but a boy of fifteen, but sorrow
had given him the stability of manhood; and never
did a more discreet, tender, and watchful Mentor
attempt the training of a female mind. Jessie was
docile and intelligent, quickly acquiring every thing
which called forth the perceptive faculties, but utterly
incapable of abstract reasoning or profound reflection.
Her mind possessed a certain activity, and a kind of
feminine patience that enabled her to do full credit
to her teacher, without ever attaining to his high
reach of thought. To cultivate her mental powers,
to impart to her a portion of his accomplishments,
and to train her moral sense, now became Herbert’s
chief occupation. That such employment of heart
and mind saved him from bitterness and misanthropy
there can be no doubt; but whether he did not pay
dearly for his exemption we shall see in the sequel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Time passed on without making any great change
in the affairs of the Darsies. Edgar went through
college rather because it was necessary to a gentlemanly
education than from any love for study, and,
immediately after graduating, he set off on the tour
of Europe. In the meantime Herbert continued to
lead his usual quiet life, driving out in his low pony-carriage
every day, teaching Jessie all she would
learn, and surrounding himself with pictures of his
own painting in the intervals of his severer studies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was on the anniversary of their birth—the day
they attained their twenty-first year—that the brothers
again met upon their own hearth-stone. Mrs. Darsie’s
health had begun to fail, and Edgar, at Herbert’s
suggestion, had unwillingly torn himself from the
enjoyments of Parisian life to return to his quiet
home. He found his mother sadly changed, and
evidently suffering from the insidious disease which
<span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span>
so slowly saps the foundations of health and life.
Herbert, like all deformed persons, had early lost the
freshness of youth, and he was not surprised, therefore,
to find him looking at least ten years older than
himself, but he was astonished at the intellectual
beauty which seemed to radiate from his noble countenance.
To the shapeless form of a stunted tree he
united the head of a demi-god. The beauty of his
classical features, the splendor of his deep, dark eyes,
and rich glossy hair curling in heavy masses round
his temples, gave him the appearance of a magnificently
sculptured head joined on to some distorted
torso.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if Edgar was startled at the change in his
mother and brother, how was he amazed and bewildered
when he saw Jesse Graham! The pale,
puny, frightened-looking little girl had expanded into
one of the very loveliest of women. At eighteen
Jessie had all that delicate yet fresh beauty which a
painter would select as his model for a youthful
Hebe. “A rose crushed upon ivory” was not too
extravagant a simile for her cheek; her lips were
like the berry of the mountain-ash; and her eyes so
soft, so tender, with just enough of their former shyness
to make them always seem appealing in their
expression, were like nothing else on earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are extravagant, Uncle Lorimer; pray how
did you avoid falling in love with such a creature?”
asked Anne, saucily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the best of all preventives—<span class='it'>pre-occupation</span>.
But my story has to do with others, not with me.
Soon after Edgar’s return, his mother took an opportunity
to inform him of her plans with regard to
Jessie. She had watched the progress of Herbert’s
attachment to his young pupil, and she believed it to
be fully reciprocated by the docile girl. She had,
therefore, as she thought, fully provided for Herbert’s
future happiness; and, lest Edgar should be attracted
by Jessie’s loveliness, she hastened to tell him that in
the beautiful orphan he beheld his brother’s future
wife. Mrs. Darsie was a weak woman, though
kind-hearted and affectionate. She proceeded to
inform Edgar how the idea first came into her head—how
she had told Herbert of it—how she had been at
first shocked at the thought of sacrificing Jessie’s
youthful loveliness to such a union—how she discovered
his secret love even from his heroic self-denial—how
she had finally succeeded in persuading
him that Jessie really loved him better than any one
in the world—and how he had at last consented to
entertain the hope and belief that Jessie might become
his wife without repugnance. To Edgar’s
very natural question, whether Jessie was really
willing to marry Herbert, his mother replied that as
yet Jessie knew nothing of their plans, Herbert
having forbidden her to use her influence in the
matter, being determined that if he won Jessie, it
should be through her own free and <a id='bias'></a>unbiased will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whether it arose from that perverseness in human
nature, which teaches men to value a thing just in
proportion to its difficulty of attainment, or whether
Jessie’s loveliness was irresistible to a man of Edgar’s
temperament, I cannot determine; but certain it is,
that from that time he looked upon her with far different
eyes than he had at first regarded her. Edgar
was precisely the kind of man who is always successful
with women. His talents and accomplishments
were all of the most superficial kind, but he
danced well, sung beautifully, played the guitar
gracefully, and withal was exceedingly handsome.
His voice was perfect music, and when he bent down
in a half-caressing manner over a lady’s chair, flinging
back his bright, silken hair, and gazing in her
face with eyes full of dangerous softness, while his
rich voice took the sweetest tone of deference and
heart-felt emotion, it was next to impossible for any
woman to resist his fascinations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was his character a perfectly natural one, uncle,
or was this exquisite manner the result of consummate
art?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was natural to him to wish to please, and he
aided his natural attractions by a certain devotedness
of manner, which made each individual to whom he
addressed himself <span class='it'>appropriate</span> his tenderness as her
own right. Jessie had lived in such close seclusion
that she knew nothing of the world or its ways. It
is probable that had Herbert asked her to become his
wife before the return of Edgar, she would have
easily consented, for she certainly loved him very
dearly, and long habit of associating with him had
accustomed her to his deformity. To her he was not
the shapeless dwarf, whose crippled limbs scarce
bore the weight of his crooked body. He had been
her ideal of excellence—the friend, the Mentor who
had made her orphaned life a blessing, and she could
imagine no stronger, deeper affection than that which
he had long since inspired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But after Edgar had been at home a few months,
she was conscious of a great change in her feelings.
She loved Herbert as well as ever, but she had
learned the existence of another kind of affection.
Edgar’s sweet words and honied flatteries were unlike
any thing she had ever heard before, and unconscious
of any disloyalty to Herbert, she gave herself up to
the enjoyment of this new sensation of happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Herbert was tried almost beyond his strength, for
it was when his mother lay on what was soon to be
her death-bed that he first suspected the fatal truth
respecting his brother and Jessie. A lingering illness,
protracted through many weeks (during which time
Herbert was his mother’s constant companion, while
Edgar enjoyed the opportunity of unrestrained companionship
with Jessie,) finally terminated in Mrs.
Darsie’s death; and, as Herbert closed her eyes, he
could not but feel that sinking of the heart which told
him that he was now alone upon earth. Immediately
after his mother’s funeral he was taken alarmingly
ill, and for several days his life was considered in
imminent danger. It was not until his recovery that
he again saw Jessie Graham, who, in compliance
with the world’s notions of decorum, had left the
home of her childhood on the decease of her benefactress.
She had found her temporary abode in the
family of a friend in the neighborhood, and Herbert’s
sick-bed had known no other attendance than that of
the housekeeper and servants. In his first interview
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>
with Jessie after his convalescence, he drew from
her a confession, or rather an admission of her love
for Edgar. The manner in which she confided this
to him—the frank, sisterly feeling which seemed to
animate her, stung him to the heart. But he possessed
great self-command, and Jessie never suspected the
actual state of <span class='it'>his</span> feelings while she confided to him
her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As soon as practicable after Herbert’s recovery,
his mother’s will was opened, and then arose a new
subject of wonder and dissatisfaction. No one but
Mrs. Darsie and her lawyer had known that she had
been merely in the enjoyment of a life interest in her
fortune; but it was now ascertained that her husband’s
estate had been very trifling, and that her
large income was the product of a handsome fortune
bequeathed to Herbert by an old uncle, in consideration
of his physical misfortunes. The yearly product
was given to Mrs. Darsie during her life, but at
her death the whole reverted to Herbert. His father’s
property, amounting only to a few thousand dollars,
was bequeathed solely to Edgar, and a legacy of five
hundred dollars, (to purchase her wedding-dress, as
the will stated,) marked the testator’s wishes regarding
her protégé, Jesse Graham. Every body was
surprised at this development, but no one more so
than the brothers. Why their mother had left them
in such close ignorance of their affairs, it is impossible
to say, but they certainly had no suspicion of
the facts until they were thus legally made known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of the first wishes of Herbert’s heart was to
see Jessie placed in her proper position, and he therefore
nerved himself to speak to Edgar on the subject.
What was his surprise, therefore, when his brother
treated the whole thing as a boyish affair, and avowed
his determination to spend his pittance (as he termed
it) abroad, and then to repair his fortunes by a wealthy
marriage! If ever the gentle spirit of Herbert entertained
a feeling of abhorrence for any living creature,
it was at that moment. His own hopes had been
ruthlessly blighted, and Jessie’s heart estranged from
him, merely to gratify a <span class='it'>boyish fancy</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What he suffered, and what he felt, however, it is
not for me to attempt describing. He had garnered
up all his treasures of affection in Jessie and his
brother. Now Jessie was lost to him, and Edgar
was a villain. How he, with his delicate sensibility,
his high sense of honor, and his stern principles of
duty, must have suffered, I leave you to imagine.
But his love for Jessie conquered all other feelings.
He knew that her happiness depended on her union
with Edgar, for she was precisely that kind of
character, which, though infirm of purpose in the
outset, yet have a certain tenacity of feeling when
once a decision has been made for them. He revolved
many schemes in his mind before he could form a
practicable one, and at last he suffered his frank and
candid nature to lead him with its usual directness
to his object. He asked Edgar to be more explicit in
his confidences, and when Edgar declared that had
he been the heir of wealth he would gladly make
Jessie his wife, but that nothing would ever induce
him to tie himself down to a life of privation and
poverty, Herbert’s decision was at once made. He
proposed dividing his income with Edgar, on condition
that his brother should marry Jessie, and reside
in the home of their childhood, while he himself
should travel into distant lands. But Edgar, with
the quick-sightedness of selfishness, saw how deeply
Herbert’s soul was interested in the matter. Pretending
a jealousy of his brother’s influence over
Jessie—a jealousy of which he declared himself
ashamed, yet which he could not subdue—he said
that if he had the means he would marry Jessie, and
take her far from all her early associations, but that
he would never let her live in Herbert’s house, or in
a place where she might at any time be subject to
his visits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pained as he was by this appearance of distrust,
Herbert’s conscience accused him of cherishing a
wicked love for one who was about to become his
brother’s wife, and he therefore submitted meekly to
this new trial. What terms were finally decided upon
could only be known at that time to the two brothers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Six months after Mrs. Darsie’s death Edgar was
united to Jessie Graham, in the little village church,
and immediately after the ceremony, the wedding-party
left for New York, from whence they sailed a
few days afterward for Havre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Herbert dismissed the greater part of the servants,
shut up all except one wing of the large house, sold
off the carriage and horses, (reserving only the little
pony-carriage, without which he would have been
deprived of all means of locomotion,) and restricted
his expenses within such narrow limits, that people
began to consider him mean and miserly. He withdrew
entirely from society, and lived more utterly
alone than ever. His books, his pictures, his music,
were now his only companions. Yet he did not forget
that earth held those to whom even he might
minister. The door of the poorest cottages often
opened to admit the distorted form of the benefactor
and friend, but the sunlight on the rich man’s threshold
was never darkened by his shapeless shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edgar Darsie went to Paris with his beautiful wife,
and there he lived in luxury and splendor, surrounded
by every thing that could minister to his love of
pleasure. Only himself and one other, the lawyer
who had drawn up the papers, knew whence his
wealth was derived. Even Jessie never suspected
that Herbert was living with the closest economy in
order that the poor should not suffer from the lavish
generosity which had induced him to secure to his
brother more than three-fourths of his whole income
as a bribe to insure her happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten years passed away, dragging their weary
length with the lonely and suffering Herbert, winging
their way on golden pinions to Edgar, weaving their
mingled web of dark and bright to the womanly heart
of Jessie. She had witnessed the changes of a fickle
nature in her husband—she had learned to endure
indifference, and to meet with fitful affection from
him—she had borne children, and laid them sorrowing
in the bosom of mother earth—she had drunk of
the cup of pleasure and found bitterness in its dregs;
and now she stood a weeping mourner beside the
<span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>
dying bed of that faithless but still beloved husband.
Edgar Darsie had inherited his mother’s disease,
together with her beauty. His excesses had hastened
the period of its development, and ten years after his
marriage he was withering like grass before the
hunter’s fire, beneath the touch of consumption. Day
after day he faded—his stately form became bowed,
his bright face changed, his silken locks fell away
from his hollow temples. Health was gone, and
beauty soon departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With the approach of death came old memories
thronging about his heart, and filling his sick chamber
with fantasies and spectres of long by-gone days.
“Take me home! take me home!” was the bitter
cry. But his “<span class='it'>home-wo</span>” came too late. Never
again would he leave his bed until he was carried
to the house appointed for all living. At the first
tidings of his illness Herbert had sailed for Havre,
and traveled with all speed to Paris; but when he
arrived there his heart failed him. He remembered
Edgar’s avowed jealousy of him, and the wild, fierce
joy which thrilled his heart when he found himself
once more near to Jessie, taught him that he was not
entirely guiltless toward his brother. He accordingly
took lodgings in the same hotel, that he might
be near Edgar, in case he should wish to see him,
well knowing that the mode of life in Paris secured
him the most perfect privacy. He made known his
present abode to a certain business-agent, through
whose hands letters had usually been sent to him
from Paris, and thus he received from Jessie’s hand
constant tidings of his brother’s condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But this state of things could not last long. His
impatience to be with Edgar led him to seize upon
the first faint intimation of a wish to see him, and he
soon found himself welcomed with tears of joy by
Jessie while Edgar thanked him with his eyes—those
tender eyes—for his thoughtful kindness in coming
without waiting for a summons. During three months
Herbert shared with Jessie her care and watchfulness
over the invalid. All the lovable qualities of Edgar’s
nature were brought out by his sickness, and Herbert
could not help feeling the full force of those
fascinations which had won for him the love of every
one. Weakened in mind as well as in body by his
disease, he was like a lovely and gentle child, so
docile, so affectionate, so helpless, so tender, and so
altogether lovely did he appear, as the dark wing of
death flung its shadow broader and deeper above his
couch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He died with penitence for past misdeeds deep-rooted
in his heart, and prayer for pardon lingering
on his lips. He died clasping his brother’s hand in
his, and the last act of his life was a vain attempt to
unite Jessie’s hand in the same grasp. There was
no time for the indulgence of selfish feeling at such
a moment. The presence of death had hushed the
whispers of earthly passion, and the grief of both the
brother and the widow was the genuine tribute of
affection to the departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As soon as Edgar’s affairs could be arranged, the
widow, with her only surviving child, returned to
America under the protection of Herbert. Ignorant as
a child about pecuniary affairs, Jessie left every thing
to Herbert, and consequently never knew at what
sacrifice he rescued Edgar’s good name from obloquy,
and paid his enormous debts. Nor did she ever know
that the money which had supported their extravagant
expenditure in Paris, was the free gift of Herbert.
But daily and hourly did she experience Herbert’s
considerate kindness. Fearing to awaken her suspicions
relative to his agency in her marriage, he
determined to continue to her an allowance similar
to that which he had bestowed upon his brother.
But to do this required new retrenchments, and the
sacrifice of a fine landed property; for Edgar’s lavish
prodigality had cost him so large a portion of his
fortune that it now needed the most careful and
judicious management.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Herbert hoped to marry his brother’s widow, he
at least determined to leave her free to choose for
herself. Jessie found herself pleasantly domiciled in
a new home, with a handsome provision for herself
and child, and surrounded by all the appliances of
American comfort before she had yet recovered from
the dull torpor of her grief. For fifteen years Herbert
had lived but for her. During the five years preceding
her marriage his whole soul had been devoted
to her; and when afterward he tried to banish her
image, he found though he might dethrone the idol,
the sentiment of loyal love, like a subtile perfume,
had diffused itself through his whole being. Was it
strange, then, if he should once more dream that his
love and faith might do more than remove mountains—that
his devotion might veil the unsightliness of his
person—that he might yet be beloved and <a id='reward'></a>rewarded?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now tell me, Annie, how do you think my story
is going to end?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the marriage of Jessie to the devoted Herbert,”
replied Annie. “It is not in the nature of woman to
be insensible to such devotion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember that Jessie knew nothing of his
pecuniary sacrifices, had no suspicion of his agency
in bringing about her marriage; did not dream of his
self-denying, self-forgetting love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But no woman could doubt the true meaning of
all his devotedness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He had never flattered her with gentle words;
never wooed her in courtly phrase; never played the
lover in the most approved fashion. He had been
the adviser, the Mentor, the steady friend; love had
been the pervading and animating soul of all he
thought and all he did, but his very magnanimity had
been as a cloak to conceal his affections. Do you
think a woman like Jessie—an ordinary woman,
lovely and gentle, but withal having no perception
of that inner life which so few can penetrate—do you
think she could see through this magnanimous reserve,
and detect the hidden love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely, surely!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Recollect that she had early learned to pity him
for his personal defects, and though ‘pity’ may be
‘akin to love’ in our sex, yet no woman ever loves
a man she must look down upon with compassion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But his nobler qualities must have commanded
her respect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>
“Suppose they were so far above her perceptions
as to inspire her with <span class='it'>awe</span> instead of respect? A
woman never loves the man she <span class='it'>pities</span>, nor will she
love the man whose superiority she <span class='it'>fears</span>. Jessie
compassionated Herbert’s bodily weaknesses, and
she had a vague terror of his stern, uncompromising
ideas of right and wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nevertheless, I am sure she married Herbert,
uncle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are mistaken, Annie. Herbert continued
his devotion for years; he learned to love her child
as if it were his own, and gave proofs of disinterestedness
and tenderness such as no woman could misinterpret;
but he never offered her his hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because he <span class='it'>knew</span> it would be rejected, and he
preferred being a life-long friend, to occupying the
position of an unsuccessful suitor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I suppose she never married again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are wrong again, Annie. At forty years of
age, when her beauty was faded, and her character
had deteriorated amid the follies of society, she
married a man some ten years her junior, who,
tempted by the income which <span class='it'>Herbert</span> had bestowed
upon her, flattered her into the belief that she had
inspired him with the most passionate love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And her child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was adopted by Herbert Darsie, and at his death
inherited his estate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor, poor Herbert!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He suffered the penalty which all must pay who
give to earth the high and holy sentiment which is
only meant to make us companion with the angels
in heaven. Not one in a thousand can love thus, and
that one always finds that in the world’s vast desert,
he has expended his strength in vain—‘hewn out
broken cisterns which can hold no water.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By permission of Mr. J. R. Smith, we have caused
a view of the Mormon Temple at Nauvoo to be
engraved from his splendid Panorama of the Mississippi,
and we give the engraving in this number.
As the building has been recently destroyed by fire,
our engraving, the first ever published, acquires additional
value. We copy from Mr. Smith’s description
of the Panorama, the following account of
Nauvoo and the Temple:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Nauvoo.</span>—A Mormon city and settlement, now
deserted. It is one of the finest locations for a town
upon the river, it being situated at the second and last
rapids below the Falls of St. Anthony, which extend
from this place to Keokuk, a distance of 12 miles.
The great Mormon Temple stands out conspicuous.
It is the finest building in the west, and if paid for
would have cost over half a million of dollars. It is
built of a white stone, resembling marble, 80 feet
front by 150 deep; 200 feet to the top of the spire.
The caps of the pilasters represent the sun; the base
of them, the half moon with Joe Smith’s profile. The
windows between the pilasters represent stars. A
large female figure with a Bible in one hand is the
vane. An inscription on the front, in large gilt letters,
reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'>“The House of the Lord, built by the Church of Jesus
Christ of the Latter Day Saints. Commenced April 6,
1841. Holiness to the Lord.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There is in the basement of the temple a large stone-basin,
supported by twelve oxen of colossal size,
about fifteen feet high altogether, all of white stone
and respectably carved. A staircase leads up to the
top of the basin. It is the font where all the Mormons
were baptized. It is seen in the Panorama
standing aside the Temple, <span class='it'>but in the basement is its
real situation</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall never have another hour’s happiness as
long as I live!” exclaimed Rose Winters, weeping
passionately. “You wouldn’t let me marry him,
father, and now he’s gone to sea, and said he should
never come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t believe it, Rose,” said Mr. Winters.
“He’ll be glad enough to come back, I’ll warrant
you—and the longer he stays away the better, I’m
thinking, it will be for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not like you, father, to be so unfeeling,” said
Rose, sobbing almost hysterically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, child—unfeeling, indeed! ay, ay, it
may be so in your judgment, I dare say, but I must
judge with the head, and not with the heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I ought to be allowed to judge for myself,
now I’m of <span class='it'>age</span>,” answered Rose, with sudden
spirit. “I was eighteen my last birthday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, Rose, you have had great experience of
mankind, no doubt. But come, now, just tell me
what you could have done if you had married Bob
Selwyn, with no fortune yourself, and he nothing to
depend on but his hands?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We could have done as other people do,” said
Rose—“we could have worked. Have I not always
worked at home, father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure you have. You have been a good,
industrious girl, Rosy, that I sha’n’t deny; but your
work at home was not like pulling continually at
the rowing oar, which would have been your portion
all your life, I’m afraid, with Robert. I can’t see,
for my part, what you wanted to marry him for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I loved him, and he loved me. Didn’t
you and mother marry for love, father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Winters could not forbear laughing at this question,
notwithstanding Rose’s grief—and his natural
droll humor struggled with his former seriousness as
he replied, “Well, I must try to remember. It is
nearly twenty years ago, now—so long that you have
come of <span class='it'>age</span> in the meanwhile, and fancy you are
wiser than your father. But I can tell you one thing,
Rose, if we did marry for love, we had something to
begin the world with, which is quite as necessary.
You know the old proverb, ‘When poverty comes
in at the door, love flies out of the window.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe any such thing, father. Whoever
wrote that proverb never knew what love was. It
was a mean thing in any man to say so; and what
would never have come from a woman, I’ll be
bound.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, Rosy, you may dry your eyes. I
wish I was as sure of a fortune for you, as I am that
Robert will be back with the ship, if his life is spared;
but if that shouldn’t be the case, you will be young
enough then, and pretty enough, too, to get another
beau.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wont have any other!” exclaimed Rose. “I
am determined to wait for him, if he stays twenty
years!”—and with this resolution she hastily turned
away and ran to her own room, where, secure from
observation, she might give free vent to her full
heart in a long fit of weeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are at a loss to imagine what sort of an impression
our rustic heroine, Rose Winters, has made
on the minds of our readers, from her unceremonious
introduction to them through the foregoing dialogue:
but at all events, she is deserving of a more detailed
description. She was the daughter of a respectable
farmer on Long Island, who resided in a country
village, situated on the Atlantic ocean, and near a
large seaport town. Mr. Winters was a shrewd,
practical man, of strong natural powers of mind, and
excellent plain common sense. Rose was his eldest
and favorite child, and inherited his independent
spirit and natural gifts of understanding, which had
been improved in her by a useful and solid education
at a first-rate country school. She was not,
perhaps, strictly beautiful, but her cheeks were bright
with the hue of health, and her dark-blue eyes sparkled
with animation, and the joyousness of a young heart,
over which a lasting shadow had never passed, until
her lover left her to try his fortunes on the sea. Her
figure was small, but of exquisite proportions, and
her steps sprang elastic with the unchecked spirits of
happy childhood. She was always agreeable and
entertaining without effort, for her words flowed in
the easiest manner possible, from a mouth which nature
had made perfect; and then there was nothing on
earth more inspiring than her merry laugh, which
seemed like the very chorus of joy, and insensibly
imparted a portion of her own gayety to all around
her. Rose had but little of imagination in her heart or
feelings. She was a young, gay creature, full of
spirits and activity, and only actuated by the every-day
scenes of life, from which she extracted mirth
and enjoyment to diffuse unsparingly among all who
came within her influence. There was also a truthfulness
and integrity in her nature, which could not
fail to give beauty, strength, and elevation to her
thoughts and character. The visions of romance
which so often pervert the minds of the young, and
throw a false coloring over the world, were all unknown
to Rose. She had been nurtured amid scenes
where there was but little to excite or enrich the
imagination, but much to awaken bold and lofty
sentiments. Born and brought up within sight and
sound of the grand and magnificent ocean, she delighted
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>
to gaze on its rolling and breaking billows,
and listen to its ceaseless sounding roar, which had
often been the solemn lullaby to her nightly slumbers.
The wide and level fields outspread before her native
home, and the few bare hills which skirted here and
there the distant outline, were but little calculated
to inspire those enchanting, but unreal dreams, which
seem insensibly to arise amid the mountain scenery
so wildly beautiful and picturesque in many parts of
our western world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose had never been twenty miles from her
father’s dwelling. All that she knew of the world
had been learned in her own village, which was an
occasional resort for a small number of strangers
during the heat of summer; but its situation was too
remote to be very generally visited before there were
either railroads or steamboats to facilitate and add
comfort and convenience to traveling. Communication
with New York, which was the nearest city,
was at that time tedious and fatiguing, as the road
lay for many miles through sandy woods, or over a
bleak and rough country. By water, the journey
was performed in sloops, taking from three days to
a week to accomplish the voyage. In consequence
of these disadvantages, the transient sojourners in
the village consisted chiefly of sportsmen, who
sought its solitary retreat for the purpose of enjoying
the game which was formerly found there in great
abundance. The birds were seldom frightened away
from the lanes and meadows, excepting by the gun
of the stranger, who, having once found his way to
that lonely yet delightful part of the country, returned
again and again, not only to scare the plover from
their haunts, but to enjoy the refreshing and invigorating
breezes from the ocean, and revel in the luxury
of freedom from fashion and restraint. There was
a primitive simplicity in the manners of the inhabitants
of the village which was peculiarly pleasing;
and in which school Rose had received her first model.
She was easy and unaffected, because seeking to
appear no higher nor better than she really was.
Among her associates, she was a universal favorite.
Her presence was sure to be in requisition at all the
balls or merry-makings in the neighborhood, for nothing
of the kind could go off well, unless Rose Winters,
with her quick wit, irresistible good humor, and
gay spirits, made one of the party. Her father, though
a man of severe morals and true piety, was far from
being puritanical in his views or feelings. He
loved to see Rose happy, and enjoyed the sunny
atmosphere which her never-failing cheerfulness and
vivacity spread around the household dwelling.
The bright sallies which flashed from her lips, instead
of being checked by the farmer, frequently occasioned
a repartee of wit from him, which gave Rose
a habit of sharpening her own against her father’s
weapons. Thus it was that she learned to respect
her parent without fearing him. She knew him to
be possessed of the most inflexible principles of
truth and rectitude; and that his jocose and lively
temperament could never induce him to swerve for
a moment from the straight-forward course of honesty
and honor. In his judgment she placed the most
unbounded confidence; and it was only in the one
instance in which her heart rebelled against it, that
she yielded to its mandate with bitter and unsatisfied
feelings. Her mother, whom we have not yet mentioned,
had been dead several years; and three sisters,
considerably younger than herself, partook more of
her care than her confidence. It thus happened that
her father had been her companion, more than is
usually the case in such relationships. She had been
accustomed to consult him in all affairs of consequence;
and self-dependent as she was by nature, she
durst not incur the responsibility of acting in direct
opposition to his counsels. In this slight sketch we
have endeavored to give a faint outline of the character
of our heroine, unlike, we are sensible, to the
usual heroines of romance; but the portrait is drawn
from real life, with its beauties unflattered, and its
blemishes unconcealed; and we leave it as it is to
make what impression it may on the opinions of
others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robert Selwyn was a native of the same village.
He was a few years older than Rose, but had been
accustomed to mingle in all the country pleasures
and amusements of which she had been for a time
the principal attraction. His handsome form, his
manly and pleasing countenance, and his gay and
careless manners, were his only passports to favor.
He had no fortune to assist him in winning his way,
but he had energy and ambition, which were yet to
be aroused into action. There was a distant connection
between the families of Winters and Selwyn,
which served as a plea for frequent and familiar intercourse.
Rose called him Cousin Robert, and under
that name he was received as a sort of privileged
guest at her father’s house. The farmer always
welcomed him; and Rose chatted and laughed and
flirted with him, until at last the flirtation ended in a
serious attachment. Mr. Winters, with all his habitual
foresight, had not looked for this result. To
part with Rose, was an event for which he had made
no calculation, and he could not persuade himself to
believe that her affections were irrevocably engaged.
The application of her lover, therefore, for his consent
to their marriage, was met by a decided refusal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh, pooh, Robert,” said he, in answer to his
solicitation, “I wonder what you would do with a
wife. Tell me first, how you expect to make a
living for yourself, let alone Rose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, if I can do nothing else, sir,” said Selwyn,
“I can follow the sea, and at least get a living out of
the whales. You know others here have got rich
that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, Robert, but it’s a hard life, and not
much to your taste, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It might not be my choice, Mr. Winters; but
I’m not afraid of hardships any more than other men—and
I should think nothing hard with Rose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s the way all young men talk when
they’re in love; but have you no other plan than that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir—I thought of either setting up a store,
or trying to get the school, as the old master is going
away. I believe I know about as much as he does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Winters laughed as he replied, “Very likely
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span>
you may, Robert, and be no Solomon either; but it
wont answer. Set up a store on credit, and break
next year; and as for school-keeping—no, no, I must
see some surer prospect of your being able to support
a wife, before you can have Rose with my
consent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Mr. Winters, none of our girls here expect
to marry rich. I wonder where they’d find husbands,
if they looked for money! not in this town, I
am sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There must be something to look to, though,
either money or business. Take my word for it,
young man, you would find love but light stuff to live
upon without something more substantial along
with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Selwyn was silent for a few moments, and then
said in a tone of severe disappointment, “Well, I
must say, sir, that I did not look for this refusal. You
never objected to my visits to Rose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but I wish I had, since neither of you have
as much sense as I thought for. I have been to blame,
and am sorry for it; but there has been enough said
now, Robert—all the talking in the world will not
alter my mind at present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was after this conversation that Selwyn, finding
the farmer inflexible, and Rose determined to sacrifice
her love rather than disobey her father, formed the
resolution to go out in a whaling ship, just about to
leave the port. Rose sought in vain to dissuade him.
He told her his mind was made up. “If you wont
have me, Rose,” said he, “I may as well be on the
ocean as the land, for I shall never marry any one
else; but I shall not hold you bound—for most likely
I shall never return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t expect to hear you say such a thing as
that, Cousin Robert,” answered Rose, with her eyes
full of tears; “but you may hold me bound or not,
just as you please, I shall wait for you. If you should
forget me, I could never believe in the love of any
man afterward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ship sailed unexpectedly, and Selwyn, much
to his disappointment, was obliged to depart without
again seeing Rose; and the sudden news that he had
gone, occasioned the burst of feeling in her, with
which our story opened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We must now pass over a few anxious and tedious
years. Rose waited and dreamed of her lover’s return,
until her spirits flagged, and her young heart
grew sick with “hope deferred.” Mr. Winters was
puzzled and confounded. He had mistaken his
daughter’s disposition, and was not prepared for the
depth of feeling and affection which she had garnered
in her bosom. That his bright and merry
Rose should suddenly become the reflective and
thinking being, and perform her household duties
with methodical and earnest care, instead of flying
like a bird from room to room, and singing or laughing
off a thousand grotesque mistakes, which before
were continually occurring under her management,
was to him a matter of serious consideration. In
truth he did not much like the change; for what was
gained in order and regularity in his house, was
lost in that inexhaustible fund of animating gayety
which had been wont to beguile him at sight of the
fatigue of daily labor, and cast an unfailing charm
over his retired dwelling. Not that Rose had altogether
sunk into the sober and serious mood—that it
was not in her nature to do—but an indescribable
change had passed over her former manner, which
had somewhat of a depressing influence on her
family. She could not help laughing and being lively,
any more than she could help the beating of her
pulse, or the breath that came without her will or
agency; but there was something missing in the inward
spring from which her spirits flowed. It was
the heart’s happiness—and the spring, in consequence,
sometimes yielded bitter waters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three years had fulfilled their annual revolutions,
before the ship returned in which Selwyn had embarked,
and then, alas! it returned without him.
The voyage had been a most disastrous one. They
had been nearly shipwrecked, after being but a few
months out, and had been obliged to put in at one of
the islands in the Pacific to repair and refit. This
operation necessarily detained them a long time; and
the second year of the voyage, Selwyn got sick and
discouraged, and left them at a port where they had
stopped to winter, and went to London. It was
hinted that he was wild and reckless, and would
never do any thing for want of stability and perseverance.
Rose was indignant at these innuendos.
Her sense of justice and generosity spurned the
meanness of traducing the absent, and her woman’s
love shielded him in her own mind from every attack
on his reputation. She received a letter from
him shortly afterward, the first he had written since
his departure. The general tone of it was sad and
desponding, but it breathed the most unabated affection
toward herself, while at the same time it set her
perfectly free from her engagement to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot ask you, dear Rose,” he wrote, “to
wait for me, when it is so uncertain if I ever can
return to claim your promise. I have made nothing
by this voyage, and am determined never to see
your father again until I can give him a satisfactory
answer to his question of ‘how I am to support a
wife.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose wept over the letter, and then consigned it
to her most secret hiding-place, and returned with
unshaken resolution to her usual train of duties. She
had lost none of her beauty, for the healthful exercise
of necessary and constant employment, preserved
the bloom on her cheek, and kept her from
giving way to useless repining. Among the beaux
of the village, she continued to have her full share
of admirers; and there was one of the number,
Edward Burton, an enterprising and promising young
man, who sought earnestly to gain her hand. It was
all in vain. Rose was deaf to his entreaties, and
laughed at his remonstrances, until he was obliged
to give up his suit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meanwhile Robert Selwyn was seeking encouragement
and advancement from a foreign people.
He continued to follow the sea, but without returning
to his native place. He went out from London, and
had risen by the usual gradation of ship-officers,
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>
lastly to captain. At the expiration of three more
years, Rose received another letter from him; but
the time of meeting seemed still further and further
in the future. He knew not when he should return.
His employers kept him constantly engaged, and he
hoped in the end to realize an independence; but it
might be long yet before it was accomplished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the burden of the letter, and Rose decided
promptly on a new course of action for herself.
She had long had it in her mind to leave home.
Her eldest sister was fully competent to take her
place in the management of the house, and the other
two were old enough to be companions and assistants;
but Rose felt that she should have to encounter the
opposition of her father. She therefore determined
on making all her arrangements to go before apprising
him of her intention. Much, indeed, then, was the
farmer astonished when Rose took her seat by his
side, after he had finished his evening meal, and addressed
him as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, I am going to New York to live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going to New York to live!” repeated he, slowly,
as if unable or unwilling to comprehend her words,
“Why what has put that notion in your head, Rose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been thinking of it for a year, father, but
put off telling you till the time came. Last summer,
when Mrs. Sandford was here, she often advised me
to go to New York; and a few days ago I had a letter
from her. She says she can get me a situation as
teacher in a school, where I shall have many advantages,
and I have made up my mind to accept it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought to have consulted me about it first,
Rose; I’m doubtful if it will be for the best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I shall do it for the best,” answered Rose,
“and if it shouldn’t turn out so, I can’t help it. You
know I’m too much like you, father, to give up any
thing I judge to be right; and I hope you wont blame
me for leaving home now, since Betsey is quite as
good a housekeeper as I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Winters bent his eyes downward, and was
silent. It was not his habit to betray any outward
emotion, but there was grief in his heart. His fortitude
was sorely tried. The departure of Rose
would cause a sad break in his home enjoyments,
and the philosophy of the man was destroyed for the
moment, by the feelings of the father. Inwardly he
struggled, till unable to control himself longer, he
rose quickly, and snatching his hat, went out from
the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some time, he returned calm and composed,
and simply remarked to his daughter, “You say
you’ve decided to go, Rose, so there’s no use in
arguing—but you’ll find a great change in a city life.
If you shouldn’t like it, come back to your old home—that’s
all. Now call the girls in to prayers—it’s
nigh bed-time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose did as she was bid—and that night the farmer
prayed earnestly and fervently for the child who was
about to quit his protection, and committed her to
the watchful care of Him who neither slumbers nor
sleeps. The prayer over, he retired immediately to
his pillow, which was wet before morning with an
old man’s unwonted tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of the following month, Rose was
duly installed in the authority of her new station.
Her active and energetic mind, on which the useful
branches of education had been thoroughly grounded,
soon comprehended all the mysteries of her office,
while her sprightliness and good humor, joined to her
unusual decision of character, fitted her admirably
for her occupation. The first term of her initiation,
however, passed wearily away. Her spirit pined in
the confinement to which she had voluntarily subjected
herself—and with a feeling of <span class='it'>home-sickness</span>
gnawing at her heart, she repaired to her patroness,
Mrs. Sandford, to tell her that she could remain no
longer. “I get thinking of my father,” said she,
“when I ought to be attending to the lessons—and
sometimes my mind gets so confused, that I almost
imagine myself mad, and the school a bedlam. Indeed,
Mrs. Sandford, I cannot engage for another
quarter. I find I was not made for a city life, after
all. The confusion distracts me, and the high houses
and narrow streets, make me gloomy and low-spirited.
I feel as if I couldn’t breathe in the smoke and dust
here. Oh, if you only knew how I long for the
pure air of the country, and the sight, once more, of
the wild, free ocean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear child,” said the lady, “you cannot
think of returning now, in the depth of winter. The
communication by water is closed, and you know it
is a three days’ journey by land in the best of traveling.
At present, they say the roads are nearly impassable.
Come, take my advice and content yourself
till spring. Believe me, you will not find every
thing as you expect when you return to the country.
A short absence from home, often produces a great
change in our own minds, and we are led to view
the same objects in a different light. New impressions
of life and manners frequently destroy the
power of old associations to bring back past happiness;
and we are left to experience a painful disappointment,
without being at first sensible that the
change is in ourselves. We can never be again what
we were before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose listened attentively, and though far from being
fully convinced by the reasoning of Mrs. Sandford,
she bent her will to a seeming necessity, and consented
to remain. Naturally buoyant, she rallied her
spirits, and overcame her transient depression. Interested
continually in receiving as well as imparting
knowledge, she said no more about returning home
until the summer vacation left her at liberty to revisit
her native town. Then it was that she understood
the change which the more experienced woman
of the world had sought to picture to her imagination.
She was once more in the bosom of her family; on
the very spot where life had opened to her with such
bright anticipations of happiness. The same scenes
were around her. The extended range of level
country, and “The sea, the open sea,” with its
mountainous and heaving billows, presented itself,
as in former days, to her unobstructed view. What
then was lost? It was the simple taste, the unsophisticated
mind, the feelings untainted with the
world, and, most of all, the heart at peace! She
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>
was no longer contented. The quietude and sameness
of the country left her too much time for thought;
and her restless spirit wandered again to the thronged
and bustling city, and the ceaseless routine of her
labors in the school as a sort of necessary means of
relief. The sight of the ocean grew painful to her,
from its reminding her too forcibly of her absent lover.
Selwyn wrote not, came not. Some said he was married
in London, and there came not a word from himself
to contradict the report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edward Burton took advantage of it to renew the
offer of his hand to Rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” answered she, decidedly, “if Cousin
Robert is really married, as people say, my faith in
man’s love is destroyed forever. I hope you will
never ask me again, Edward, for my answer will
always be the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Burton gave her up, and consoled himself by
marrying another; and Rose returned to New York,
and again devoted herself to the arduous task of
teaching, which often filled her heart with weariness;
yet no one would have imagined her to be a disappointed
girl. <span class='it'>Love-sick</span> she was not; she had too
much strength of mind—but she was true-hearted
and constant. Nine years had elapsed since she had
heard a word of Selwyn, and she knew not whether he
were living or dead. They had been parted <span class='it'>fifteen
years</span>; and who will wonder that time had robbed
her of some of her early bloom; but there was an
added expression of intellect in her countenance,
and a certain refinement of manner imperceptibly
acquired, which she had never possessed in her
father’s house: so that altogether she was more attractive,
more to be admired at thirty-three years of
age, than when she first appeared at eighteen as a
country belle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And where was Robert Selwyn, while by slow
gradations from year to year this change had been
silently wrought in his heart’s first idol. His migrations
in the meantime had been many, and his fortunes
varied. Profits and loss were for some years
nearly balanced in his accounts, but at length the
brighter side predominated. Misfortunes and mishaps
were cleared away from his horizon, and his
sails swept onward through a tide of unexpected
success. It was then that he began to weary of his
long, self-imposed exile, and turn his thoughts and
wishes to home and “native land.” Energetic in
purpose, and prompt in action, he no sooner formed
the resolution of returning than it was put in execution.
The voyage, quickly accomplished, he once
more found himself among his old friends and townsmen,
who shook him heartily by the hand, and welcomed
him back with right good will. Some author
remarks, that “one of the greatest pleasures in life,
is to be born in a small town, where one is acquainted
with all the inhabitants, and a remembrance clings
to every house.” He no doubt felt this on his first
arrival, and his satisfaction was unalloyed; for, like
Rose, he had yet to know himself as he now was.
Most of his youthful companions were married, and
settled down into steady, sober-minded, every-day
sort of people—having made but little improvement
either in mind or manners; but they were not slow
to perceive that the Selwyn who had just returned,
was quite a different man from the Selwyn they had
formerly known. There was certainly a change in
him, but in what it consisted, they found it impossible
to decide. He lacked nothing in cordiality—he
assumed no airs of superiority—he was neither
<span class='it'>elegant</span> nor <span class='it'>fashionable</span>—but he was not what he
used to be. Perhaps it was that he had acquired
more manliness of character; and there was the least
bit more of dignity in his manners; he was the
smallest possible degree more guarded in his expressions;
and his frank and easy address was entirely
free from the most distant approach to awkwardness.
It is true, he was still the gay and jovial
sailor, noble-spirited and generous to a fault—but he
was more the gentleman, more the man of the world
than before he went to foreign parts; and upon the
whole, the conclusion was that he was greatly improved,
and would most likely turn out to be quite a
credit to the town. He had certainly grown handsomer,
as he had grown older. His face wore no
traces of any inward discontent or disappointment,
and it is probable that he had worn his love either
lightly or hopefully in his heart. His first inquiry,
after his return, however, was for Rose; and hearing
she was in New York, he hastened thither to meet
her. It was at the close of a summer afternoon
when he found himself at the door of the house where
he was told she boarded. He inquired for her,
walked in, and sat down in the parlor in the dim
light of the fading day, which was rendered more obscure
in the shadow of the curtained windows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose had gone to her room fatigued and somewhat
dispirited. The name of her visiter was unannounced,
and as she descended with a languid step
to the parlor, she was little prepared for the surprise
that awaited her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Selwyn rose at her entrance with a confused and
doubtful air. “I beg your pardon, madam,” said he,
“I called to see Miss Winters—Rose Winters—I
understood she was here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so she is, Cousin Robert!” exclaimed Rose.
“She is before you, and yet you do not know her.
Am I altered so very much, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question was accompanied with a painful
blush, from the consciousness that the bloom of youth
in which he had left her, had passed away forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Selwyn sprang toward her and caught her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rose, my own dear Rose,” said he, with real
feeling, “forgive me. No, you are not altered; but
if you were, I should know your voice among a
thousand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, I know I have grown old, cousin,” said
Rose, struggling to recover herself, “how could it
be otherwise, when so many years have passed since
we met.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Rosy, look at me! Has my age stood still,
do you think? Look at the crow’s feet and the gray
hair, and tell me if you love me the less for them.
You would be the same to me, if you were twice as
old as you are; for you see I have come back for
no earthly reason but to marry you, unless your own
<span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>
consent is as hard to obtain now as your father’s
was before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, your friends said you were married in
London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not my <span class='it'>friends</span>, Rose. It must have been
my <span class='it'>enemies</span> who said that; but <span class='it'>you</span> knew better.
Didn’t I tell you I would never marry any one
but you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, fifteen years ago, Cousin Robert—but the
promise might be outlawed by this time, for all I
knew. You do not pretend to say that you thought
my faith in your word would hold out, without even
receiving a line from you the last nine years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not pretend to say it, coz, when I know it
has. Deny it now if you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why didn’t you write to me, Robert?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I’m no writer, and meant to come myself.
You said you’d wait for me—and I knew you
never broke your word. So now, my sweet little
flower, I’ve come to claim you, like a blunt sailor,
as I am, with few words, but a heart full of love,
and what is better, something to live on beside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are in a great hurry now,” said Rose,
laughing and blushing. “Suppose you wait a little,
seeing you learnt the art so well in your absence.
Why I have not had a chance yet to ask you what
kept you away so long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind that, coz. There ’ill be plenty of
time hereafter. Answer my question first, whether
you mean to have me or not, and let me know
which way to shape my course. If you’ve changed
your mind, and lost your affection for me, just say
so at once, and I’m off to sea in the first ship. You’ll
never be troubled with me again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an unreasonable man you are,” said Rose,
“just as impatient and headstrong as before you
went away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You knew all my faults, dearest, long, long ago,”
said Selwyn. “They did not hinder you from loving
me once. Love me still, Rose, as you once did.
Be mine, as you promised you would before we
parted, and you shall make me what you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose was silent. Her lover’s arm was around
her, and memory was holding its mirror to her mind:
and when she did speak at length, her voice was low
and indistinct, and her words nearly unintelligible.
The spirit of them may be guessed, however, from
the fact that Selwyn did not go to sea, and she resigned
her situation as teacher, and returned with
him to her former home. The wedding was soon
after celebrated with the sanction of her father, and
but one source of regret to Rose, that the old minister,
who in her youthful days was the pastor of her
native village, had been removed in the meanwhile
to another world, and the ceremony of her marriage
was performed by a stranger.</p>

difference, and, but for the ear-rings and knee-breeches,
would pass muster even now amid our
infinite varieties of <span class='it'>palelots</span>, <span class='it'>sacks</span> and <span class='it'>Hongroises</span>.

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is worth while to state that costumes, like
opinions, reproduce themselves. As the ideas which
were once in vogue, and have been abandoned, return
and resume their influence and orthodoxy, so
do the costumes of other days continually reappear,
it is true, with a difference often striking enough, for
men no longer wear either coats of mail or inexpressibles
of velvet, yet the Norman cloak of the
Black Prince, and the <span class='it'>sack</span> of Lauzun, the handsome
French colonel, who, during our own Revolutionary
war, turned the heads and carried away the
hearts of half the women of Philadelphia, are still
every day to be seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same thing is observable in female costume.
The long waists, tight sleeves and full skirts of old
times have returned, and even the ungainly ruffs of
Queen Elizabeth’s age have shown a disposition to
return. The mode of dressing the hair is also retracing
itself, so that there is little real difference
between the traditional court-dress of former times
and that of every-day life worn at present, except
the train.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span>
The following is a caricature of that day, but
scarcely more outré than the bearded creatures from
time to time seen in our own streets. It may be remarked
that the passion for hair on the face always
is consequent on a war. In the time of Henri IV,
all the world was bearded; so during the days of
Cromwell were his ironsides, and now men who
never saw a shot fired, force the sublime into the
ridiculous, by parading a moustache in every thoroughfare
throughout the country.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Who knows but that our own Mexican war may
exert an influence on dress, and that some day the
Ranchero’s striped blanket and broad-brimmed hat
may become the fashion. Men will stalk about the
streets in boots of cow-hide, and instead of hunting
with dogs and rifles, the <span class='it'>lazo</span> or <span class='it'>lariette</span> will be
adopted universally. All the world knows that immediately
after the return of the army of the Duke
of Wellington to England, from Waterloo, the military
black stock was adopted, and it may be that the
green pantaloons with the brown stripe, now worn,
are an imitation of the dress of the Mexican veterans
who were defeated at Cherebusco. The same may
be said of the cloth caps, with the covers of oil-skin,
now so much in vogue. It may be remarked that
this article of dress has always followed the <span class='it'>tenue</span> of
the army, the flat cap replacing the hussar’s, as the
latter did the old gig-top leather apparatus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other nations of Europe did not participate in the
French Revolution, but became imitators of the costumes
it created. We have now come to the period
of the Directory, which exerted its influence on costume,
or rather the influence of which was reflected
by the costume of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Directory and Consulate saw all France seized
with fury for the antique. These were the days of
the <span class='it'>Romaines</span> and <span class='it'>Atheniennes</span>, when David was
toiling with the pencil to effect a reform of costume,
and when Talma sought to introduce correct ideas
of dress on the stage. The men of Paris still adhered
to the English costume, which, fortified by
their <span class='it'>fiat</span>, became that of the world. They compromised
their English predilections, however, so far as
to wear their hair <span class='it'>à la Titus</span> or <span class='it'>à la Caracalla</span>,
what that was may be seen from the following
engraving.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i117.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0008' style='width:375px;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>They seemed, however, to struggle to make this
costume as unbecoming as possible, wearing the
coats loose, the collars immense, the breasts small,
and such pantaloons and <span class='it'>shocking bad</span> hats as were
never seen before or since. The costume of a dandy
of 1798 consisted of a blue coat, a white waistcoat,
open in the breast, a finely worked shirt-bosom,
fastened with a diamond pin, a huge muslin cravat,
Nankin pantaloons, with black stripes down the
seams, and thrust into the boots. (In society the boot
was replaced by a small and pointed shoe.) The
everlasting bludgeon was as indispensable in the
street as the boots and the hat. To young Thelusson,
when thus dressed and armed, Madame de Stael,
who wore an oriental <span class='it'>toilette</span>, said, “Citizen, you
bear the sceptre of ridicule.” “Madame,” replied
he, “you are certainly competent to award it to
whom you please.” Never were there so many
strange costumes seen in any one city as in Paris
at that time, when <span class='it'>peruques</span>, powder, hair <span class='it'>à la
Titus</span>, cocked and round hats all were mingled together.
Costume was indeed republican if the government
was despotic.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='bold'>CAROLINA OR MOCKING WREN.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>This interesting bird is strictly southern in its
habits, being rarely found north of Maryland and
Delaware, while it abounds during the whole year
in the warmer states. Occasionally it strays to the
vicinity of Philadelphia and even of New York;
but this is so seldom that the indefatigable Wilson
never found its nest north of the Maryland line.
Like the House-Wren it is a sprightly, industrious
and familiar bird, and a general favorite in the neighborhood
where it abounds. Other qualities render
its nature so ambiguous that some have hesitated to
place it among the Wrens. One of the most remarkable
of these is its power of imitating the songs
of other birds. With much sweetness and accuracy it
blends its own notes with the simple twittering of the
Ground-Robin, the harsh noise of the Woodpecker,
the trilling of the Blackbird and Warbler, and the
whistling of the Cardinal. These are its favorite
imitations; but its powers of mimicry embrace the
songs of almost all our forest-birds. But notwithstanding
this capriciousness in sounds, the Carolina
Wren is said to have a favorite theme, repeated
more regularly than any other. Nuttall thus pleasantly
describes it. “This was the first sound that
I heard from him, delivered with great spirit, though
in the dreary month of January. This sweet and
melodious ditty, <span class='it'>tsee-toot</span>, <span class='it'>tsee-toot</span>, <span class='it'>tsee-toot</span>, and
sometimes <span class='it'>tsee-toot</span>, <span class='it'>tsee toot-seet</span>, was usually uttered
in a somewhat plaintive or tender strain, varied
at each repetition with the most delightful and delicate
tones, of which no conception can be formed
without experience. That this song has a sentimental
air may be conceived from its interpretation by the
youths of the country, who pretend to hear it say,
<span class='it'>sweet-heart</span>, <span class='it'>sweet-heart</span>, <span class='it'>sweet</span>! nor is the illusion
more than the natural truth, for, usually, this affectionate
ditty is answered by its mate, sometimes in
the same note, at others in a different call. In most
cases, it will be remarked, that the phrases of our
songster are uttered in 3s; by this means it will be
generally practicable to distinguish its performance
from that of other birds, and particularly from the
Cardinal Grosbeak, whose expression it often closely
imitates, both in power and delivery. I shall never,
I believe, forget the soothing satisfaction and amusement
I derived from this little constant and unwearied
minstrel, my sole vocal companion through many
weary miles of a vast, desolate, and otherwise cheerless
wilderness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The food of the Carolina Wren consists of the insects
found in old timber, and along the banks of
streams, places which it delights to frequent. It is
found among the thick cypress swamps of the south
even in the middle of winter. It can see well in the
dark, sometimes searching food in caves, where to
most other day birds objects would be undistinguishable.
Its building places are a barn, or stable, some
old decayed tree, or even a post-fence. The female
lays from five to eight eggs, of a dusky white, mottled
with brown. Two broods are raised in a season,
and sometimes even three. The adult bird is five
and a quarter inches long, of a chestnut brown, beautifully
mottled with black and other colors. The
female differs little in color from the male.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='bold'>THE CARDINAL BIRD.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>This bird is known under the names of Virginia
Red Bird, Virginia Nightingale and Crested Red
Bird. It is one of the most beautiful of American
songsters, and in power and sweetness of tone it has
been compared with the Nightingale. The species
belongs mostly to the United States and Mexico, but
has been found in considerable numbers in the West
Indies, Central America and Colombia. Although
delighting in a southern clime, it is sometimes observed
in Pennsylvania, and even New England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being migratory, it often flies in large flocks, presenting
a splendid appearance, especially when
moving in relief over a clear sky, and in the rays of
the sun. At other times several of these birds are
found associated with Sparrows, Snow-Birds and
other half domestic species. When alone his favorite
haunts are the corn-field, small clumps of trees, and
the borders of shaded rivulets. Corn is their favorite
food, in addition to which they eat seeds of fruit,
grain and insects. They are easily domesticated,
even when taken quite old, and require very little
trouble in order to thrive well. Loss of color, however,
has often been the result of long confinement,
although with care this might perhaps be obviated.
They are lively in the cage, and maintain their
powers of song to the last. Numbers of them are
carried to France and England, where they are
highly esteemed. Their time of song lasts from
March to September.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cardinal Bird’s song consists of a favorite
stanza often repeated, with boldness, variety of tone
and richness. Its whistling somewhat resembles that
of the human voice, though its energy is much
greater. In his native grove, his voice rises above
almost every other songster except the Mocking-Bird.
The powers of the female are almost equal to
those of the male, of whom she is a most constant
and affectionate partner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Latham admits that the notes of the Cardinal “are
almost equal to those of the Nightingale,” the sweetest
of the feathered minstrels of Europe. But, says
Nuttall, “the style of their performance is wholly
different. The bold martial strains of the Red Bird,
though relieved by tender and exquisite touches, possess
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>
not the enchanting pathos, the elevated and varied
expression of the far-famed Philomel, nor yet
those contrasted tones, which, in the solemn stillness
of the growing night, fall at times into a soothing
whisper, or slowly rise and quicken into a loud and
cheering warble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cardinal Bird measures eight inches in length,
and eleven from the tip of one wing to that of the
other. The whole upper parts are of a dull dusky-red,
except the sides of the neck, head and lower
parts, which are of a clear vermilion. The chin,
front and lores black. The head is ornamented with
a high pointed crest. The bill is coral red, and the
legs and feet are pale ash color. The female is somewhat
less than the male, and a little different in
color. Both sexes are noted for affection to their
young, and to each other; but so jealous are the
males that they have often been known to destroy
those of their own sex.</p>

<p class='line'>To the charm of thy music we ever would yield,</p>

Lewis, Author of “Records of the Heart,” etc. etc. New

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A large edition of “Records of the Heart” was sold in
a few months, and the fair author stepped at once into a
very enviable position. “The Child of the Sea,” etc. will
add much to her poetical fame. The poem which gives
name to the volume, and occupies most of it, is a romantic
and passionate narrative, and embodies all the main features
of Mrs. Lewis’s thought as well as manner. The
story is well conducted and somewhat elaborately handled;
the style, or general tone, is nervous, free, dashing—much
in the way of Maria del Occidente—but the principal
ground for praise is to be found in the great aggregate of
quotable passages. The opening lines, for example, are
singularly vivid:</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The History of England, from the Accession of James II.
By Thomas Babington Macaulay. New York: Harper
&amp; Brothers. Vols. 1 and 2. 8vo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>No person, of whig or tory politics, could in the present
age, propose to himself the task of writing the history of
England, without feeling the delicacy and responsibility
of his undertaking, and the necessity of exercising a different
class of powers from those which may have given
sparkle and point to his partisan efforts. The importance
of the principles involved in the events and characters
coming under his view, and their wide applications to
contemporary controversies, would be sure to bring down
upon the unlucky advocate a storm of moral and immoral
indignation. It would seem on the first blush that Macaulay,
with all his vast and vivified erudition, was not
a writer calculated to experience the full force of a historian’s
duties, or to display in the analysis and judgment
of events that intellectual conscientiousness which is a
rare quality even in powerful minds. His historical
essays bear as unmistakable marks of partisanship as
ability, and are especially characterized by a merciless
severity, which, in the name of justice, too often loses the
insight us well as the toleration which come from charity.
Sir James Macintosh, toward the commencement of his
career, referred to him as “a writer of consummate ability,
who has failed in little but in the respect due to the abilities
and character of his opponents.” Though as a partisan,
Macaulay was a partisan on the right side, on the side of
liberty and truth, the unmeasured scorn he poured, hot
from his heart, on tyrants and bigots, and the fierce,
swift sweep of his generalizations, often made his cooler
readers suspicious of his accuracy when most dazzled and
delighted by his brilliancy. In the present history a great
change is manifest. The petulance, the flippancy, the
dogmatism of the essayist, are hardly observable, and in
their place we have the solid judgment of the historian.
There is a general lowering of the tone in which persons
and principles are considered, consequent upon the change
in the writer’s position from an antagonist to a judge. The
style, while it has no lack of the force, richness, variety,
directness and brilliancy, which characterized the diction
of the essayist, has likewise a sweetness, gravity and
composure which the essayist never displayed. Though
the writer’s opinions are radically the same as ever, they
are somewhat modified by being seen through a less extravagant
expression, and by being restored to their proper
relations. In fact, the history presents Macaulay as a
wiser and more comprehensive man than his essays, and
if we sometimes miss the generous warmth and intensity,
and the daring sweep of his earlier compositions, we also
miss their declamatory contemptuousness and mental
bombast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The volumes which the Harpers have given to us in so
elegant a form, (vulgarized a little by Dr. Webster’s ortho-graphical
crotchets,) close with the proceedings of the
Convention which gave the crown to William and Mary.
A long historical introduction, containing a view of
English history previous to the reign of James II., and a
view of England, in its manners, customs, literature and
people at the time of his accession, occupy the larger portion
of the first volume, and are almost unmatched, certainly
unexcelled, in historical literature, for the combination
of condensed richness of matter with popularity of
style. Then follows the narrative of the three years of
folly and madness which produced the revolution of 1688,
and hurled James II. from his throne. This narrative is
detailed with a minuteness which leaves nothing untold
necessary to the complete apprehension of the subject in
all its bearings, and it evinces on almost every page not
only singular felicity in narration, but great power of
original and striking observation. Masterly generalization,
and sagacity in seizing and luminousness in unfolding
the principles of events. The whole history has the
interest of a grand dramatic poem, in which the movement
of the story and delineation of the characters are managed
with consummate skill. The portraits of Charles II.,
James II., Danby, Rochester, Sunderland, Godolphin,
Halifax, Churchill, and especially William of Orange, are
altogether superior to any which have previously appeared.
Halifax and King William seem to be Macaulay’s favorites,
and he has surprised many of his readers by his
comparative coolness to Russell, Sydney, and the whig
patriots generally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The history closes with an eloquent passage on the
“glorious” Revolution of 1688. It appears to us that the
meanness and lowness which Macaulay has developed
in the actors in the event, impress the reader with a
different notion of it. The whole thing has a jobby air,
in which no commanding genius is observable, and no
sacrifices seem to have been made. Indeed Macaulay
himself, in one of his essays, remarks truly that the only
sacrifices made in the Revolution, “was the sacrifice
which Churchill made of honor and Anne of natural
affection.” That the Revolution, in its results, was one
of the most glorious recorded in human annals, there can
be little doubt, but it had its birth in such odious treachery,
and was conducted by men so deficient in elevation of mind
or even common honesty, that its story is little calculated
to kindle sympathy, or awaken admiration.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The History of England from the Peace of Utrecht to the
Peace of Paris. By Lord Mahon. Edited by Henry
Reed, Professor of English Literature in the University of
Pennsylvania. New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co. 2 vols. 8vo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The author of this history is all English nobleman of
large historical acquirements, who has managed to produce
two or three valuable works demanding great study
and research, without interfering with his duties as a
member of Parliament, though, doubtless with some interference
with his pleasures as a member of the English
aristocracy. The present work is valuable for its accuracy,
and interesting from its giving a connected view of the
history of England during a period but little known except
by the empty abstracts of stupid compilers, or the brilliant
but prejudiced letters and memoirs of contemporary
writers and statesmen. It comprehends the administrations
of Harley and Bolingbroke, of Stanhope, Walpole,
Carteret, Newcastle and Chatham, thus including the
latter years of the reign of Queen Anne and the reigns of
George I. and II. The period covers a wide field of
characters and events, and Lord Mahon has been especially
successful in unraveling the threads of the foreign policy
of England, and indicating the difficulties experienced by
her statesmen in sustaining the House of Hanover on the
throne. In a narrative point of view the best portions of
the history are those relating to the rebellions of 1715 and
1745. It is almost needless to say that Professor Reed
<span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span>
has added much to the value and interest of the work by
his elucidative notes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the richness of Lord Mahon’s materials and the
interest of his subject cannot conceal the fact that he lacks
both the heart and the brain of an able historian, and that
he is essentially a common-place man. The reflections he
appends to some of his narratives are commonly such
obvious truisms, or such poor apologies for reason, that
the reader is made painfully aware of his being in the
company of a mediocre gentleman, who, while he always
means well, never means much. Lord Mahon is deficient
equally in historical science and historical imagination,
and his work equally barren of profound principles and
vivid pictures. A moderate tory, he holds the hearsays
of his creed with a lazy acquiescence, without sufficient
passion to be a bigot, and without sufficient logic to be a
sophist. When he is tempted into historical parallels, or
disquisitions on the changes of parties, as in that passage
where he essays to prove that a modern whig is synonymous
with a tory of Queen Anne’s day, he adopts the argumentation
of Fluellen rather than Chillingworth—shows that
“there is a mountain in Wales and a mountain in Macedon,”
and leaves the reader to mourn over the misdirection
of the human faculties. In his estimate of literature he is
still worse. The disquisition on the literature of Queen
Anne’s time, in the present history, is a medley of mingled
commonplace, which has been worn to rags, and critical
nonsense, which has been long exploded. His history,
therefore, must be considered simply as a useful narrative
of important events, and carefully distinguished from those
of Guizot and Thierrey, of Hallam and Macaulay, of Prescott
and Bancroft.</p>

Massachusetts Bay, 1678-9. Boston: Ticknor, Reed &amp;
Fields. 1 vol. 16mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This beautifully printed volume sustains both the reputation
of its publishers for printing handsome books, and
its reputed author for writing good ones. It is generally
attributed to Whittier, and it certainly displays throughout
the shrewdness with which that poet observes, and
the facility with which he idealizes events. Here is a
volume bringing up to the eye with the vividness of reality
the scenes and characters of a past age, and making us as
familiar with them as if we had ridden by the side of Margaret
in her journey from Boston to Newbury, and yet
through the whole book runs a vein of pure poetry, lending
a consecrating light to scenes which might possess
but little interest if actually observed. The quaint spelling
undoubtedly adds to the illusion of its antiquity, but
what makes it really seem old is its primitive sentiment
and bold delineations. Margaret herself is a most bewitching
piece of saintliness, with the sweetness and
purity of one of Jeremy Taylor’s sermons, and as full of
genial humanity as of beautiful devotion. Placed as she
is amid the collision of opposite fanaticisms, the austere
fanaticism of the Puritan and the vehement fanaticism of
the Quaker, she shines both by her own virtues and by
contrast with the harsh qualities by which she is surrounded.
The book provokes a comparison with the
Diary of Lady Willoughby, and that comparison it will
more than stand, being superior to that charming volume
in the range of its persons and events, and equal to it in
the conception of the leading character. The author has
shown especial art in modifying every thing, by the supposed
medium of mind through which it passes—the heroine
telling the whole story in her own words—and at the
same time preserving every thing in its essential life.
This is a difficult and delicate process of representation,
but Whittier has performed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This little volume is well worthy the reputation of one
of the greatest historians, philosophers and statesmen at
the age—in other words, of the reputation of Guizot. It
is marked by preeminent ability in statement, analysis,
argumentation and composition, and we doubt not will
exert some considerable influence on the politics of France.
In his preface the author avers that nothing in the volume
bears the impress of his personal situation, and he adds,
“While events of such magnitude are passing before his
eyes, a man who did not forget himself would deserve to
be forever forgotten.” The book justifies the author’s
assertion. It is simply an examination of things without
regard to persons, and is as philosophic in its tone as in
its method. The chapters on The Social Republic and
The Elements of Society are masterpieces of analysis and
statement, and well deserve the attentive study of all who
think or prattle on social science. It seems to us that the
present volume is sufficient to convince all candid minds,
that whatever may be the faults and errors of Guizot as a
statesman, he has no equal among the men at present
dominant in France. Since his fall that country has been
governed, or misgoverned, by soldiers and sentimentalists,
with a pistol in one hand and the Rights of Man in the
other, and is a standing monument of the madness of trusting
the state to men of “second rate ability and first rate
incapacity.” The Red Republicans have principles; M.
Guizot has principles; the legitimists have principles;
but the present dynasty has the peculiar character of being,
in an intellectual sense, the most thoroughly unprincipled
government that French ingenuity could have
formed.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Oregon and California. By J. Quinn Thornton. New
York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1849.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A pleasant book, well written, and containing much information
just now, peculiarly valuable in relation to
Oregon and California. Many strange phases of life in
the wilderness and prairie, are described by one who
knows its peculiar hardships and pleasures. The terrible
sufferings, the awful stories told of the early emigrants,
are faithfully given, and, if official accounts be true, are
scarcely exaggerated. A valuable appendix on the gold
country is added, undoubtedly to be relied on. The book
is well illustrated in wood.</p>

By D. W. Belisle. Philadelphia: J. B. Lippencott

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A pretty looking volume, very creditable to the publishers
in a typographical point of view, and containing
a number of poems of various lengths, on a variety of subjects.
The longest, Wallenpaupack, is an attempt, and a
very creditable one also, to commemorate an incident of
the history of the North American Indian, a source of
poetical subjects too much neglected. The book is well
worth attention. It may not be uninteresting to state that
the type has all been set up by the author.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Roland Cashel. By Charles Lever. Illustrated by Phiz.
New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is probably the best novel of one of the most popular
novelists of the day. Lever has not much solidity of mind,
and accordingly never produces any masterpieces of characterization
or passion, but he has a quicksilver spirit of
frolic and drollery, and an intensity of mirthful feeling which
have made some critics place him on a level with Dickens.
The present volume will more than sustain the reputation
which his former frolicksome audacities have attained.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>“GRAHAM” TO “JEREMY SHORT.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>My Dear Jeremy</span>,—In my last I promised you a reminding
hint, a sketch reflective and suggestive of mining
operations, as an offset to the brilliant visions of “Gold
Placers,” which haunt the mind, sleeping and waking, of
Uncle Sam’s children. While multitudes are making haste
to grow rich, by going around the Horn, and at the terminus
of their long voyage will find themselves coming
out of the little end of it, you and I may amuse ourselves
over a subject somewhat kindred—a retrospective folly—feeling
the while a good deal like the boy on getting rid
of the jumping tooth-ache—“a <span class='it'>heap</span> better” are we, “now
it is over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Copper!</span> You have heard of it before, I believe? and
may have about you a memorandum of a few thousands,
entered on the credit side, not available now at your
bankers. It was a very happy delusion, was it not? I’ll
warrant me that you had already planned your cottage
orné and had the walks laid out, and the shrubbery planted
quite tastefully and imaginatively picturesque. Several
castles, with steeples rather airy, of my own, were toppled
down, and elegantly bronzed as they were, are quite
useless now for purposes of reproduction, so that we may
say, that we have had some of the advantages of wealth
without a present care in disposing of it. The servant
girl who wished for riches “that she might ride in her
carriage and feel like missus,” had the delights of anticipation
only, poor soul! while ours are embodied in the
delicious reflection of having passed that “missus” on the
road, with a pair of fast trotters—taking the air with quite
an air, at the rate of “two forty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come easy, go fast,” was the remark of an old German
Uncle, who, having made a fortune by hard knocks at the
anvil, looked with a quiet smile at these thousands in perspective.
In regard to the <span class='it'>horses</span>, the old gentleman was
right—but as the <span class='it'>money</span> never came, I think his premises
were altogether wrong. One thing is certain, real estate
rose very rapidly in our vicinity at that time, and as several
lots went off at spanking prices, to be kept out of our
clutches, we may be said to have been benefactors to the
sellers and conveyancers. So that <span class='it'>copper</span>—the vilest of
metal—may, in some crucibles, be transformed into gold.
But not to anticipate.</p>

<hr class='tbk149'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Grubemout</span> had been upon the mountain-side, which
overlooks the delightful village of Fleeceington, for a
month or more, making careful chiselings from rocks,
and excavations at their sides. <span class='sc'>Uptosnuff</span> carried his pick-axe
and his basket. The “collection” gradually swelled
upon their hands, until it became quite formidable; and
the “choice specimens,” were without number, rich, and
without reason, <span class='it'>rare</span>. <span class='sc'>Drawitwell</span>, the host of “The
Hawk and Buzzard,” had his eye upon their movements,
and always made it a point to take a peep at their basket
when they descended in the evening. He was an open-eyed
sort of an old lark, who had had his own way in the
village at election times and at trainings, by virtue of a
colonelcy and aidship to the governor—a cheap sort of
payment for service rendered—and he felt as if nothing
of importance ought to transpire in the place, unless he
had a hand in it. Drawitwell did not like the air of
mystery with which his lodgers slipped the covered basket
up stairs, after they had performed their ablutions; nor
the roaring noise made overhead, as the “specimens”
were poured into the two great chests, previously prepared;
and he was just the man to get at the bottom of
a mare’s nest. So, by virtue of appliances best known to
himself, he contrived to get a look at the collected specimens,
and made up his mind at once that the thing was
too slily managed by half, and that if there was wealth in
the rocks he would have a finger in the transaction.
“<span class='it'>He would at any rate.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crispin, the village cobbler, had thrown <span class='it'>his</span> eyes from
his lapstone, across the creek, and up the hill-side, to take
note of the motions of “the wandering stone-crackers,”
as he called them, and his brain was in a pother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blacksmith had sharpened their pick more than once,
which had put on edge his curiosity, and had “contrived
to pick their brains, while they pecked the rocks,” as he
jocosely remarked, and <span class='it'>he</span> had smelt metal in their
movements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over their evening ale, at the tavern, the probabilities
and possibilities of gold or silver being found in the mountain,
were discussed with various degrees of profundity,
and the certainty that something of the kind was there,
was most sagely resolved on. Time, in whose crucible
all doubts are solved, soon confirmed their sagacity by a
“copper button” presented to the landlord with the compliments
of Uptosnuff, with hints, but not positive injunctions
as to secrecy. He knew his man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think of that?” asked Drawitwell, of his
cronies the same evening, with an air of authority, holding
up the copper button. “What <span class='it'>do</span> you think of that,
my lads?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Hellow!</span>” exclaimed the bewildered cobbler, “landlord,
why—why is <span class='it'>that goold</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gold, you fool! No, it’s <span class='it'>not</span> gold—but it’s a precious
sight more valuable—because there is a great deal more
of it used.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why what on earth is it, then?” asked the blacksmith,
in amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s <span class='it'>Copper</span>! my lads! <span class='sc'>Copper!!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Copper!!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I reckon it is!—and the genuine metal, too!
And the mountain is as full of it as an egg is of meat!
Only melt down one of the rocks up there, and you’ll see
how it will fly out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To have stopped the spread of such information as this,
would have surpassed the ingenuity of our clerical friend,
who was opposed to the Magnetic Telegraph, as “a device
of the devil.” There was a California excitement in a
village, with California itself in their own mountain. <span class='it'>He</span>
would have been a lucky traveler, who could have had
his horse shod for a guinea, or a bridle-rein mended for
double the amount.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, my lads!” says Drawitwell, haranguing
the crowd, “they are going to do the fair thing by us, they
have bought the land, and are getting their act of incorporation
ready, and we are all to have shares in it at a
reasonable rate—and I reckon I’ll have a <span class='it'>few</span>, or money
must be scarce in Fleeceington. There’ll be high times at
the “Hawk and Buzzard”, <span class='it'>now</span>, I should say, when every
man in this prosperous village can be an owner, for a
small sum, in one of the richest mines on the face of the
earth. You see it’s going to be most unconscionable high,
too—it’s now twenty-two cents a pound—for the government
<span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>
is advertising for it in the newspapers—no doubt to
make bullets with to match the infernal poisonous Mexicans.
Gad, we’ll give the rascals a taste of their own
physic, <span class='it'>now</span>, I reckon! And then don’t they make water-pipes
with it now, and sheetings. And don’t they cover
houses with it, and ships; and I guess the time is not far
off when government will have her mint on this spot—and
what’s to hinder us, <span class='it'>then</span> from spending our own
coppers, bran new, ha! ha! If any body here has got a
farm for sale, I’m his man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for buying farms, the thing was perfectly absurd
now, and Drawitwell should have known it; for who
could tell that there was not a copper-mine under every
one of them. It was not to be supposed either that the
good people of Fleeceington could keep the knowledge of
such extraordinary wealth all to themselves, and our
usually quiet city was all agog, with the wondrous stories
of the extent and richness of the mines; and to confirm its
truth, Grubemout and Uptosnuff were here with the
charter, and the script elegantly engraved, and any number
of specimens, and copper-buttons confirmatory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a day or two a few shares were in the market at “a
slight advance on the original cost.” Capitalists had been
up who thought they “knew a thing or two”—and gudgeons
began to nibble, the knowing ones among the
number. The market advanced. One, two, three, four
hundred per cent. was quickly achieved as competitors
increased; and considering that the first cost was perhaps
a dollar an acre, for an unwooded, untillable, rocky hillside,
curved up and set down at a dollar per square foot
as “original cost,” the profit was tempting—the market
active—ditto the original holders. There was a fierce
avidity for a stock which advanced at such rapid strides,
and the reckless became crazy, the cautious reckless and
visionary. “The Board”—knowing dogs—looked on for
a while doubtfully, but in amazement. The “Outsiders”
indulged in ecstasies and fanciful millions. Thousands
were added up upon stock-books, as if they were “trifles
light as air”—<span class='it'>and they were</span>. Merchants cut the shop—lawyers
the red tape and sheep-skin—editors told the
messenger for copy to “go to the devil”—and all became
“gentlemen on ’change.” Healths were drunk “to the
United Copper-Heads”—and champagne and Havanas
“suffered some.” Fun and puns flashed fast and furious—and
all this the while the great bubble rose up, expanding
and beautifying as it ascended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not to be expected that a single mountain should
contain all this good luck exclusively, and in various
quarters envious copper-rocks poked their noses out, quite
seductively to anxious companies, who formed upon the
spot. One gigantic intellect proposed the formation of a
company to shovel the sand off of the whole State of New
Jersey, so as to get at the substratum, at once and emphatically.
Copper became substantially the <span class='it'>great</span> business
of life—the <span class='it'>only</span> business of the board—the <span class='it'>board</span>
being in fact rather a small affair while <span class='it'>copper</span> abounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sharp occupied <span class='it'>his</span> time in buying up superfluous real
estate, which seemed to have been infected by copper,
and showed a disposition to <span class='it'>rise</span>—and he was afraid it
might go up and never come down again. The conveyancers
assured him that he ought to take it—like a sportsman—on
the wing, right and left. He did, and clapped a
heavy mortgage on it to keep it steady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That disturbed the figures on Flat’s memorandum—for
he hoped to have bought and paid for it with his expected
profit on copper, and to have staggered somebody else’s
property with a mortgage from the surplus. It was
provoking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jones and Wilkins resolved to “take a shy at the
copper anyway, while it was going;” but the stock of all
the companies seemed shy of them. They “bid ten
dollars through a broker”—it was twelve. “Bid twelve”—it
was fourteen. Wilkins had had enough of it. He believed
it was “only a bubble blown up to catch the eyes
of fools. He was done with it.” But Jones was down
in the morning, as merry as a lark, and as early. He
“knew some of the outsiders, and thought he would catch
some of them before the morning was over.” He did—and
went home to dinner, having made “a fortunate hit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five hundred shares,” said he, “at fifteen, and the
last sale ‘after board,’ nineteen and a half! Four dollars
and fifty cents per share. Five aught is <span class='it'>naught</span>; five
fives are twenty-five, five fours are twenty, and two are
twenty-two. Twenty-two hundred and fifty dollars—that
will do for one day, <span class='it'>I</span> should say. Wilkins would
like me to give <span class='it'>him</span> half, as we were to have gone in together
yesterday, but I wonder what Wilkins ever did for
me, that I should give <span class='it'>him</span> eleven hundred and twenty-five
dollars! Not <span class='it'>quite</span> so green!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning Grubemout brought down some specimens,
which “he thought” would yield forty per cent.
<span class='it'>if they were assayed</span>, and thought that they ought to make
an assessment of a dollar a share, so as to put on more
hands and drive out the ore. Jones said that “that was
right enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The assessment was called in, at which the stock hesitated
for a day or two—made a start and went on—but a
second installment being urged, it faltered a little, and
then stopped. At the third it “<span class='it'>declined</span> a shade,” at
which the “bears” gave a shake and a growl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Grubemout had—in the nick of time—“just received
a letter from the mines of the most important nature,
which it would not do to show in ‘the street,’ or
the stock would be balooning it—Uptosnuff had <span class='it'>just made
a cross-cut</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The deuce he has!” exclaimed Jones, rather nervously.
“What is <span class='it'>that</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A cross-cut, you see,” says Grubemout, “is nothing
more than ‘a shaft’ run at right angles past the old one
we have been working. He struck some glorious ‘deposites,’
and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why I thought you always said there was <span class='it'>a vein</span>,
Grubemout? These deposites are confoundedly leaky and
treacherous affairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so there <span class='it'>is</span> a vein, my boy, and we are just getting
into it; deposites are always the first thing we look
for in copper mining. As long as we have them we get
on swimmingly; but you are so confoundedly skittish! I
was just going to tell you, that in making the ‘cross-cut,’
Uptosnuff has struck ‘<span class='it'>the master vein</span>!’ and found an old
‘<span class='it'>drift</span>’ in the mountain, which you will see after a while,
is important. In it he found old hatchets, and hammers,
and images in copper, supposed to have been the rude
efforts at mining and smelting by the Indians long ago—say
before the Dutch had taken Holland, or achieved the
renowned name of Knickerbockers, and had gone home
copper-fastened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Information so desirable as this would work its way out
somehow, and gentlemen would now bet you a trifle—say
champagne and cigars—that a dividend of twenty-five
per cent. would be declared on the stock the first year; or
would <span class='it'>give</span> you a hundred dollars for agreeing to pay the
annual dividend on a hundred shares.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jones is “satisfied <span class='it'>now</span>,” and forthwith buys five hundred
shares more, as do other Joneses, and Browns, and
Greens. Outsiders became as plenty as gooseberries, and
as verdant; and it would seem, from the number of shares
reported <span class='it'>at</span> the Board, and “<span class='it'>after</span>,” that certificates had
quadrupled, and never <span class='it'>could</span> multiply fast enough to supply
the demand. Indeed, as one old gentleman was heard to
<span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>
end a prolonged whistle, by exclaiming—“<span class='sc'>Gas!</span>” the
market became so inflated that the Joneses, Browns, and
Greens, declined the attempt of <span class='it'>cornering</span> the stock, in
despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The company,” called for an additional installment at
once. “Why, what the deuce,” asks Jones, “does the
company want with <span class='it'>more</span> installments? <a id='have2'></a>Haven’t they got
copper enough!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Copper <span class='it'>ore</span>, my dear fellow,” responded Grubemout.
“Yes, <span class='it'>lots</span> of it. But Uptosnuff wasn’t brought up in a
Cornish mine for nothing. The furnaces at Baltimore and
Boston want it for half-price, but as they are nearly <span class='it'>out</span>,
we intend to make them <span class='it'>smoke</span>, ha! ha! But we must go
to the expense of an “<span class='it'>adate</span>” in the meanwhile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what’s the use of <span class='it'>that</span>—what good will that
do?” asks Jones. “What <span class='it'>is</span> an <span class='it'>adate</span>, anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Jones had a good deal yet to learn about copper-mining,
and felt naturally alarmed at these ominous terms.
The “cross-cut” was the beginning of puzzlers. He had
yet to see—I may as well say he ultimately did see, “the
drift,” to help along “the pumps,” as well as the adate
with installments, and to become familiar with a variety
of mining lore, which assists knowledge in its acquisition,
by obligingly allowing us to pay for it. But I believe he
never <span class='it'>did</span> understand “what they wanted with so many
work-shops—<span class='it'>he</span> thought they were <span class='it'>miners</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An <span class='it'>adate</span>, Jones, is only a drain to relieve the mine
when it is overcharged with water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! is that all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this calling in of installments seems to be a sort of
patent condenser in the stock market, and shows with
how much force a given quantity of air can be squeezed
into a given compass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grubemout was as active as a bee at sunrise, and offered
his advice gratuitously—but “confidentially”—to any
number of anxious <span class='it'>inquirers</span>—but some of <span class='it'>them</span> having a
copper-mine of their own, by the attractive and <span class='it'>taking</span>
name of “<span class='it'>Penny</span>-wise Company,” and others having
taken a snap with the “Alligator Mountain Company,”
and not liking the bite they received, shook their heads at
Fleeceington and looked knowing—the “New Jersey”
chaps were quite sprightly, for as their <span class='it'>title</span> covered the
whole State, they had a fair chance of <span class='it'>realizing</span> something
when the “Mammoth Shoveling Company” got to
work, and lifted the crust off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grubemout assured them—“on his honor”—that “the
Company did not intend to sell an ounce of its ore to
the furnaces. They intended to have ‘<span class='it'>a crushing machine</span>’
of their own erected at once, and proceed in a style
that would soon settle the whole business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jones was “ready for any number of crushers or
mashers, grinders or pounders. Head up the creek—dam
it! Put up the water-works and the mill-wheel, and give
it to the <span class='it'>blasted</span> furnaces! Carry the war into Africa!”
said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The installment to carry on the adate was paid, though
it depressed the stock, but Jones could not see how having
paid the company five thousand dollars in installments
should depress <span class='it'>his</span> stock in the market. “Hang it!” said
he, “the company is that much richer in property and excavations,
and don’t I belong to the company—haven’t I
a thousand shares? It’s only paying money out of one
pocket, and putting into the other. Wilkins may laugh,
but he’s a fool! That’s a capital idea about the furnace.
You’re a boy, Uptosnuff—<span class='it'>you</span> are?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The installment for <span class='it'>crushing</span> purposes was soon called
in also, and paid, though the stock looked sickly, and
trembled as if it had the ague, or had passed through a
crushing process on its own hook. It was just composing
itself when Uptosnuff discovered that it was of the highest
importance to the company to have a small engine and an
iron pump erected at the mines at once, <span class='it'>as the richest ore
is always found below water level</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jones—the active, energetic Jones—“had no doubt of
it at all. The Cornish miners assured him, when he was
up, that as soon as they got below water level, they would
come to something that couldn’t be trifled with. If Wilkins
wasn’t a fool he would go in soon, before it gets out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uptosnuff, too, had had a quantity of the late ore assayed,
and Professor Stuffemwell, Geologist to Her Majesty,
thought it would <span class='it'>do</span> bravely. If ore that yielded fifty per
cent. would not, he would like to know how her majesty’s
subjects got rich, after paying the miners, on mines that
yield but fifteen per cent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Copper buttons now replenished the pockets of dealers,
and the stock made several violent gasps and starts for a
desirable existence. But it was consumptive—evidently
going into a rapid decline. The crushing process and the
iron pump having depressed its spirits, and exhausted still
further its vital energy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grubemout thought that if the buttons were pressed
into <span class='it'>bars</span>, and shown upon Change it might be encouraging,
and mitigate the violence of the disease; but some
wag of a broker suggested that it was “<span class='it'>a</span> <span style='font-size:smaller'>BAR</span> <span class='it'>sinister</span>;”
which remark sinister ruffled the backs of the <span class='it'>bars</span>, caused
the bulls to toss their horns unpleasantly, and shook still
further the liveliness of the stock, which drooped visibly
under the imputation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even <span class='it'>Jones</span>—the ardent, trustful Jones—got earnestly
anxious about the state of the patient, and “suggested a
consultation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Brown</span> was full of good intentions, but “pleaded debility
of the pocket, which, under heavy depletion, was
rather low.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Green</span> was a little vivacious, and “suggested a new
<span class='it'>cross-cut</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Grubemout</span> was pleased with the idea, and hinted at “a
new installment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Uptosnuff</span> had “missed the stage, and was unable to
get down to the meeting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Wilkins</span>, in answer to a pressing invitation to “<span class='it'>come
in</span>,” was “busy selling goods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Sharp</span> would not attend—“he had never had any thing
to do with the rascally copper, and found his real estate
bad enough just now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Flat</span> “had enough of copper stock—it was not very
heavy, to be sure, having rather a tendency to dissolve
into air, its original element, but he was satisfied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The Stock</span> grew feebler after consultation, as patients
are apt to, in critical cases, from want of remedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The Bulls</span> looked surly, as if they had been disappointed
in pasture.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The Bears</span> were as frisky as it is possible to be on a
frosty morning, and were so much in their own element,
that you looked involuntarily around for floating icebergs—and
copper in this temperature of the atmosphere sunk
into a torpor.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>On Change</span>, in this changing world of ours, copper
looked blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The Outsiders</span> had rubbed out their pencil-marks on stock
memorandums, and dissipating the written evidence of
thousands that had vanished into air, they themselves
vanished. It was needless to say any thing to <span class='it'>them</span> about
copper, they “never had any thing to do with it, beyond
a hundred shares or so, which they sold out before the
bubble looked like bursting.” Stockdom was desolate,
save that a few of the bears showed their teeth, and grinned
as furiously as if they had just arrived fresh from the
Polar regions, and had brought any quantity of wet
blankets with them. Yet they looked as if they would
<span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span>
rather than not that any dealer in copper should take hold
of them. The bulls were more plentiful—looked savage
but knowing, but showed no disposition to dash at imaginary
enemies in scarlet, having rather a taste left for their
friends, the Browns and the Greens, who were urgently entreated
to “come <span class='it'>in again</span>, and help sustain the market.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The case was desperate, and desperate remedies were
resolved on. It was deemed advisable to “ask <span class='it'>the opinion</span>
of the directors!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The directors “<span class='it'>have</span> no opinion of the stock! They
never <span class='it'>had</span>,” of their own. They trusted to Grubemout,
to Uptosnuff, to the Cornish miners. Their geological
and mineralogical education, had been shockingly neglected
in their youth, and they have verified the fact, by having
on their hands, a thousand shares apiece at high
prices, by having assisted to sustain the market in the
various stages of the experiment. But “they <span class='it'>would</span> like
to know who were the ‘original’ stockholders of the company
who did them the honor to elect them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grubemout “thought it of the highest importance that
they <span class='it'>should</span> know, and as the original book of minutes
was up at the mines and as he was going up by the next
stage, would write and send them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would be, perhaps, as well to give his letter:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='it'>Fleeceington, Dec. 10, 18—.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Gentlemen</span>,—I arrived safely at the mines last evening,
after rather a fatiguing journey by stage, and found,
to my unspeakable amazement, that Uptosnuff had exhausted
the vein, and that as no more deposites are to be
found he had thought it advisable to abandon the mine.
The tools, viz., four pickaxes, three shovels, and two
wheelbarrows—rather dilapidated—the property of the
company, I have put under shelter, to preserve them from
the weather—subject to your order or disposal. The iron
pump I should have removed also, but being rather heavy
in the absence of the hands—who have gone back to their
farms—I found it impossible to take in. It cannot, however,
suffer from rust more than ten per cent., and as the
original cost was but seventy dollars, the loss to the company
will be inconsiderable. There is a trifle of two hundred
dollars due, for boarding the hands, to the host of the
“Roaring Lion,” who will forward you his account by
this mail. As Uptosnuff and myself have suffered a great
deal from anxiety, and exposure in the mines of the company,
we deem it proper to seek a more genial clime.
Any little complimentary remuneration which you may
see proper to bestow on us, you will please enclose to
Mr. Drawitwell, of the Hawk and Buzzard, to whom we
are indebted for various little civilities, in the shape of
breakfast, dinner and supper, for the past six months, and
which no doubt the generosity of your complimentary
donation will amply cover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Enclosed are “the original minutes.” Uptosnuff wishes
to be remembered <span class='it'>by</span> you. I join in the same prayer.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:10em;'>Yours, as ever,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>Christian Grubemout</span>, <span class='it'>Pres’t.</span></p>

</div>

<hr class='tbk150'/>

<p class='noindent'>To the Directors, Stockholders, etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>P. S. Please ask Jones to think of us. Not that it is
any of our business, but would like to know whether he
ever divided with Wilkins—it would be civil, you know.
Regards to the Bulls. Uptosnuff says ditto to the Bears,
for there is no knowing when one may want a friend, and
civility costs nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Minutes, First Meeting.</span>—At a large and enthusiastic
meeting of the joyous and delighted inhabitants of the
charming and romantic village of Fleeceington, held at
“The Hawk and Buzzard Hotel,” to elect officers for the
newly discovered, freshly chartered, and highly valuable
and productive Copper Mine, just incorporated by an act
of the Legislature, under the name, style and title, to wit:</p>

<hr class='tbk152'/>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>The Grand Open Sesame and United Catchem Copper
Mining, Crushing, Stamping, Pumping and Smelting
Company</span>,”</p>

<p class='noindent'>Christian Grubemout, Eliakim Uptosnuff, J. Drawitwell,
T. Crispin and John Smith, the original incorporators of
the Company, after regaling themselves, proceeded to the
election of officers, and knowing that in the goodly city of
Philadelphia there were a number of persons by the names
of Jones, Brown and Green, and not a few Sharps and
Flats, they, in order to avoid giving offence, placed in a
hat the whole of the names, as above, found in the <span class='it'>Directory</span>,
(significant of the office they were to hold,) and drew
the following first three names, A. Jones, B. Flat, C.
Green, <span class='it'>directing</span> them to supply vacancies, and to fill additions
to the number <a id='off'></a>of five; adding in the meanwhile
the names of the first two corporators, as <span class='it'>ex-officio</span> directors,
to conduct silently the operations of the mines,
and to enlighten the others as to the true plan of working
copper-mines profitably and efficiently.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'>(Signed) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. GRUBEMOUT, <span class='it'>Pres’t.</span></p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:5em;'><span class='sc'>E. Uptosnuff</span>, <span class='it'>Sec’ry.</span></p>

</div>

<hr class='tbk153'/>

<p class='pindent'>The cleverness and explicitness of the whole transaction
showed that it had <span class='it'>been done</span> neatly; and the Directors
with singular unanimity felt themselves included in the
operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There can be no doubt that Grubemout and Uptosnuff
are among the “placers” in California. The one being
undeniably the man who sold the two barrels of brandy,
by installments of a thimblefull at a time, for $14,000—the
other, with positive certainty, we aver to have been the
man who “confidentially” communicated the following
<span class='it'>item</span> to the newspaper press, and he must have been there
to have seen it:</p>

<hr class='tbk154'/>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div style="position:absolute;margin-left:-.5em; font-size:150%;">“</div><p class='noindent'><img src='images/H.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='H'/><span class='it'>The <a id='big'></a>Biggest Lump Yet?</span>—The following is about
the latest news from the gold diggins that we have seen
recorded in the ‘papers:’ A runaway soldier is said to
have discovered a lump or a rock of gold that weighed 889
pounds and 11½ ounces; he was afraid to leave it, and
mounted guard upon it, and at the latest dates he had sat
there 17 days; had offered $27,000 for a plate of pork and
beans, but had been indignantly refused, and laughed at
for the niggardliness of his offer, by parties going further
on, where this article was said to be <span class='it'>more abundant</span>!”</p>

</div>

<hr class='tbk155'/>

<p class='pindent'>Jones is among the lame ducks, and pretty roughly
plucked at that. But he still avers that if the furnaces
had only paid a good price for the ore at the outset, or
Wilkins had only helped him to sustain the market when
he asked him, he should have been the master of a pretty
snug little fortune. If he only had it <span class='it'>now</span>, he would charter
a steamer, and take his own freight and passengers for
the gold mines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hawk and Buzzard appears to have been “<span class='it'>pidgeoned</span>,”
for the last time I passed that way the house was
shut up. The business having amused itself by stepping
over to the Roaring Lion, while the Hawk and Buzzard
had flown to the city, “to watch the market.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crispin “would only like to have one of those fellows
tied for a while, until he had expressed his opinion on him
with a stirrup.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Smith appears to be solicitous to “make them intimately
acquainted with the red-hot end of a poker—he’d
<span class='it'>smelt</span> ’em, <span class='it'>dam</span> ’em, and <span class='it'>crush</span> ’em too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “Dam,” the “Drift,” the “Cross-Cut,” the “Iron
Pump” and the “Adate,” you can see as you go wood-cock
shooting next August—but the “Steam-Engine” and
the “Mill-Wheel” never arrived, owing to some informality
in the order given to the mechanics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>The Crusher</span>,” it is supposed, is in California with
its friends.</p>

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
